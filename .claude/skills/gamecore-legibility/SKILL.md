description: Make every GameCore screen readable on a TV from the sofa. Use for ANY UI change (themes in config/themes/, frontend components, settings pages, pad hints, overlays, Electron HUD). Sets the contrast and size floors, says how to fix a failure without making the UI look generated, and ships legibility-audit.mjs, which renders the real screen and measures contrast against the pixels behind each text and icon.

# GameCore legibility

GameCore is read at 3 m on a TV that washes out colour. A hint the player
cannot read is a broken feature, whatever it looks like on a monitor.
Measure it. Do not trust your eye on a laptop.

Pairs with `gamecore-human-touch`: fix legibility with the theme's own
material. Its paper, glass or ink. Never with a generic glow or gradient.

## 1. Floors

| What | Floor |
|---|---|
| Body text, labels, hints | contrast ≥ 4.5:1 against the pixels behind it |
| Text ≥ 24px, or ≥ 18.66px bold | ≥ 3:1 |
| Icons, pad glyphs (✕ ○ □ △, d-pad, L1 pills) | ≥ 3:1 |
| Any text a player reads | ≥ 14px at 1080p; hints and legends 16px+ |
| Focus | visible without colour: shape, ring, scale or weight too |

"Behind it" means the real backdrop: wallpaper pattern, photo, sand, a
panel's glass over the sky. The worst common pixel counts, not the average.

## 2. What breaks it, and the fix

| Cause | Fix |
|---|---|
| Hierarchy by low alpha (`rgba(255,255,255,.3)`, `opacity: .4`) | Named ink tokens (`--ink-2`, `--ink-3`, `--gc-ink-3`, `--set-ink-3`) each checked ≥ 4.5:1 on the surfaces they sit on. The faintest ink is still readable |
| `opacity` on a container to dim it | Dim the drawing only; text inside keeps full ink. Unfocused tiles: no opacity, use the focus signals |
| Text straight on a pattern, photo, sand | A plate in the theme's material behind it (Shelf: paper label; Summer: glass pill). Not a text-shadow, not a gradient scrim over everything |
| Pale pad glyphs on a light surface | Set `--gc-pad-cross`, `-circle`, `-square`, `-triangle` on that surface (≥ 3:1). `padKey.js` defaults are for dark screens; `initial` restores them in a dark panel inside a light theme |
| Brand colour as text on dark (PS blue `#003087`) | Lighten for text: `color-mix(in srgb, <brand> 45%, #fff)`; keep the raw brand colour for fills |
| 8–12px labels "for elegance" | 14px floor, 16px for hints. Hierarchy from weight and ink, not from shrinking |
| Decoration over text (a shell on the hint bar) | Move the decoration. Decoration never covers text |
| Status colours tuned for dark (`#f59e0b`) on a light card | Theme sets `--set-warn/info/danger/ok` dark enough for its card |

Exempt, and only these:
- text drawn as part of an object, when the same fact is readable elsewhere
  (box spine, back-of-box fine print);
- illustrations marked `aria-hidden="true"` (the controller drawing, the
  ghost art when no pad is connected);
- disabled controls (`disabled` / `aria-disabled="true"`), e.g. index letters
  with no game. The ones that do something must pass. If something carries information that
  is not repeated as readable text, it is not decoration.

## 3. Measure

Dev server. It is read-only (every write but the theme switch gets a 403:
an audit press once launched Steam on the box) and never runs the real
lifespan (`sudo -n cpupower`, and failed sudo attempts lock the account):

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/gcdata/config && cp install/generated/systems.json.dist /tmp/gcdata/config/systems.json \
  && cp install/generated/apps.json.dist /tmp/gcdata/config/apps.json && cp -r config/themes /tmp/gcdata/config/
# a library with games: empty files with real names
mkdir -p /tmp/gcdata/emu/azahar && touch "/tmp/gcdata/emu/azahar/"{"Mario Kart 7","Pokemon X","Kid Icarus - Uprising"}" (Europe).3ds"
(cd frontend && npx vite build)
GAMECORE_PATH=$PWD GAMECORE_DATA=/tmp/gcdata PYTHONPATH=$PWD \
  python3 .claude/skills/gamecore-legibility/scripts/devserve.py &
```

Re-copy `config/themes` into `/tmp/gcdata` after each theme edit; rebuild the
frontend after each `frontend/src` edit.

Audit, per theme and per screen:

```bash
A=.claude/skills/gamecore-legibility/scripts/legibility-audit.mjs
for t in default orbit shelf summer; do
  node $A --theme $t                           # home
  node $A --theme $t --press confirm          # library (Orbit: --press r1,confirm)
  node $A --theme $t --press x                # controller screen
  node $A --theme $t --press power            # power menu
  node $A --theme $t --press menu             # settings
done
node $A --theme shelf --press x --shot /tmp/shelf-pad.png --all   # every item + screenshot
```

It prints `FAIL` for contrast, text under 14px, or text under decoration, and
counts 14–16px text as "small" (`--all` lists them). Exit 1 on any `FAIL`.
How it measures: one screenshot with all text and icons hidden, then the
backdrop is sampled under each item and the 10th-percentile ratio is kept.
Items another screen covers are skipped.

Limits: empty ROM files all get the same scraped art; fine for layout.
The built-in UI ignores synthetic presses, so only its home is audited here;
its settings and power pages share `frontend/src/settings/css` with the
themes. The TV is the final check: look at it before merging.

## 4. Checklist

- [ ] audit run on every theme × screen the change touches: 0 `FAIL`
- [ ] new colours are tokens in the theme's DESIGN.md, with their ratio
- [ ] no text dimmed by `opacity` or by an alpha below the theme's ink-3
- [ ] hints and legends 16px+, nothing read under 14px
- [ ] pad glyphs checked on every surface they appear on (light buttons too)
- [ ] fixes use the theme's material (see `gamecore-human-touch`), no glow
- [ ] `--shot` screenshots before and after in the PR
