"""Dev-only: serve the app WITHOUT its lifespan, with the boot steps marked
done so the UI leaves its splash, and READ-ONLY.

Read-only because this is the real backend on the real box: a ✕ press during
an audit once launched Steam. Every write is refused (403) except switching
the theme, which the audit needs. Never run the real lifespan in dev either:
it calls `sudo -n cpupower`, and failed sudo attempts lock the account.

    GAMECORE_PATH=$PWD GAMECORE_DATA=/tmp/gcdata PYTHONPATH=$PWD \
        python3 .claude/skills/gamecore-legibility/scripts/devserve.py

GAMECORE_DATA needs config/systems.json and config/apps.json (copy them from
install/generated/*.dist), config/themes/ (copy from the repo), and ROMs as
empty files under emu/<system>/ for a library with games.
