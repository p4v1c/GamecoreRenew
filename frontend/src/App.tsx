          the core too — a theme that simply forgot to draw a session bar would

          but cannot remove it, and cannot decide when booting ends: onDone is
          ours, and a theme that never calls it hits the watchdog above.

          "Above" has to be built here, because a theme is forbidden to write a
          z-index (docs/themes/README.md §6 — the shell owns stacking) and being
          later in the DOM is not enough: the shell paints its own layers at
          z-index 1, 400 and 500, and a positive z-index beats a `auto` one
          whatever the source order. A themed splash therefore came up UNDER the
          dashboard — the boot animation visible only in the gaps between the
          system tiles, the wordmark hidden behind them entirely. The default
          Splash never showed it because it sets zIndex 9000 on its own root,
          which is a thing only the host is allowed to do.

          So the host supplies the layer and the theme keeps drawing inside it,
          with no rule bent on either side. Same 9000 as the default splash: the
          two are mutually exclusive, and matching keeps one number to change. */}

          and without a curtain that fade would reveal a dashboard still
          filling itself in. One mechanism, no theme sniffing, and the older
          theme keeps working. */}
