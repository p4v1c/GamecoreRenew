#
# This is NOT a security boundary. The conf is `source`d — it is already
# arbitrary shell, and whoever writes it could simply put a command in it. It is
# a guard against the file being WRONG, which is a far more common event now
# that three different things write it: the graphical wizard, the ISO's guided
# install, and whoever is scripting more than one box.
#
# The failures it stops all share a shape — they do not appear here, they appear
# twenty minutes later, somewhere that does not mention the conf:
#   · a USER_NAME with a space writes a sudoers file `visudo -cf` rejects, at 84 %;
#   · a GAMECORE_PATH with a space produces `ExecStart=/opt/Game Core/.venv/…`,
#     which systemd splits into a command and an argument — the unit fails at
#     the first boot, long after the installer said "Installation complete";
#   · a WEB_PORT of "8765 " or "http" reaches Caddy and the backend, and the LAN
