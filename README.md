## What it does

GameCore is a full-screen game launcher designed to run on a dedicated machine connected to a TV.  
You navigate with a gamepad, launch emulators, and never touch a keyboard.

**Supported emulators (out of the box):**

| ID | Emulator | System |
|----|----------|--------|
| `dolphin` | Dolphin | GameCube / Wii |
| `duckstation` | DuckStation | PlayStation 1 |
| `pcsx2` | PCSX2 | PlayStation 2 |
| `rpcs3` | RPCS3 | PlayStation 3 |
| `ppsspp` | PPSSPP | PSP |
| `cemu` | Cemu | Wii U |
| `ryujinx` | Ryujinx | Nintendo Switch |
| `azahar` | Azahar | Nintendo 3DS |
| `mgba` | mGBA | Game Boy Advance |
| `melonds` | melonDS | Nintendo DS |
| `gopher64` | Rosalie's Mupen GUI (Mupen64Plus core) | Nintendo 64 |
| `xenia` | Xenia Canary | Xbox 360 |
| `shadps4` | shadPS4 | PlayStation 4 |

> - **Nintendo 64**: the pack **id** is `gopher64` but the emulator installed is **Rosalie's Mupen GUI** (`com.github.Rosalie241.RMG`), a front end over the Mupen64Plus core — which is why its config file is `mupen64plus.cfg`. The id is a key: it names the catalogue directory, `emu/gopher64/` on every installed box, and the controller snapshots. Renaming it without a migration would move a player's N64 library under a path the scanner no longer reads, so it stays.
> - **PlayStation 1** uses the official DuckStation **AppImage** — the Flatpak was discontinued upstream in 2025.
> - **Xbox 360** runs Xenia Canary **through Wine** (`lib/xenia/xenia_canary.exe`, downloaded by the full installer).
> - **PlayStation 4** uses the shadPS4 Flatpak; games are folders (`emu/shadps4/<Game>/eboot.bin`, `scanDirs`).
> - Everything else installs from Flathub. Full-mode installs grant each emulator `--filesystem` (ROMs) and `--device=all` (controller) overrides automatically.

## Requirements

| | Minimum |
|--|---------|
| OS | None — the [ISO](#burn-the-iso-recommended--no-linux-needed-first) installs the system. Arch Linux / Manjaro if you install onto an existing machine. |
| Firmware | UEFI, **Secure Boot disabled** (the ISO is unsigned) |
| Display | 1920×1080 (Full HD) |
| GPU | Any — hardware acceleration recommended |
| RAM | 4 GB |
| Storage | 80 GB + (60 GB system + your ROM library) |
| Controller | Any XInput / evdev gamepad |

All emulators are installed via **Flatpak**. Make sure Flatpak is available on your system before running the installer — the ISO ships it.

---

## Installation (device)

> Run this on the machine that will act as the kiosk.  
> The installer sets up auto-login, auto-start, and all dependencies.

### Burn the ISO (recommended — no Linux needed first)

The ISO installs on a bare machine. You do **not** need to install Arch, or
anything else, beforehand: the image carries the whole system, GameCore
included, so the install works with no network at all.

1. Download the image and its `.sha256` from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/p4v1c/GamecoreRenew/releases/latest).

   The image carries a whole desktop and all three GPU driver stacks, so it is
   often larger than the 2 GiB GitHub allows for one release asset. When it is,
   the release carries `….iso.00.part`, `….iso.01.part` … and a
   `REASSEMBLE.txt` instead of the `.iso`. Download every part and the
   `.sha256`, then join them:
   ```bash
   cat gamecore-*.iso.*.part > "$(basename gamecore-*.iso.sha256 .sha256)"
   ```
   Reassemble to the name the `.sha256` carries, not to one you make up: the
   checksum file names the image mkarchiso produced, and `sha256sum -c` looks
   for that exact name on disk. `REASSEMBLE.txt` in the release spells the
   name out if you would rather copy it by hand.
2. Check it — a truncated download produces a stick that boots halfway. The
   checksum covers the whole image, so it verifies a reassembled one too:
   ```bash
   sha256sum -c gamecore-*.iso.sha256
   ```
3. Write it to a USB stick of 8 GB or more. **`of=` is the disk, not a
   partition** (`/dev/sdb`, never `/dev/sdb1`), and everything on it is lost:
   ```bash
   lsblk                 # find the stick, check the size before you trust the name
   sudo dd if=gamecore-*.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress oflag=sync
   ```
4. Boot the target machine from it, **in UEFI mode, with Secure Boot disabled**.

> **Secure Boot is not supported in this version** — nothing in the image is
> signed. Turn it off in the firmware setup ("Secure Boot" → Disabled, usually
> under Security or Boot). Most firmware also lists the same stick twice in the
> boot menu; pick the entry prefixed **UEFI:**. The installer refuses to
> continue in legacy BIOS mode rather than producing a machine that will not
> boot.

The wizard starts on its own. It asks which disk to take, then the same
questions as the desktop installer (user, emulators, addons, API keys).

**The selected disk is erased completely.** It is repartitioned as:

| | Size | Filesystem | Mounted |
|--|--|--|--|
| EFI system partition | 1 GiB | FAT32 | `/boot` |
| System | 60 GiB by default | ext4 | `/` |
| Player data | the rest | btrfs | `/userdata` |

`/userdata` is a separate partition on purpose: ROMs, saves, covers and config
survive reinstalling the system, and can be snapshotted on their own.

When the wizard finishes, remove the stick and reboot. **The first boot finishes
the installation** — services, kiosk, and the emulators if a network is
available — printing what it is doing on the screen, then reboots into GameCore.
It takes a while and it has not hung.

Emulators are Flatpaks and are the one thing that cannot be baked into the
image. With no network they are reported and skipped, and installed later from
the Systems screen.

Building the ISO yourself needs Arch (or an `archlinux` container), root, and
about 25 GB of scratch space:

```bash
sudo bash install/iso/build.sh          # → out/gamecore-<version>.iso + .sha256
```

### Install onto a machine that already runs Arch

**Graphical installer** — a native step-by-step wizard, like any
desktop installer. Download `gamecore-installer` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/p4v1c/GamecoreRenew/releases/latest), then:

```bash
chmod +x gamecore-installer
./gamecore-installer
```

Pick your emulators and addons, paste your API keys (optional), hit Install —
it asks for the administrator password (polkit), downloads the latest GameCore
release and does everything. Re-running it is safe.

**Command line** (SSH / no graphical session):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/p4v1c/GamecoreRenew.git
cd GamecoreRenew
sudo bash install/arch.sh                      # interactive prompts
sudo bash install/arch.sh --unattended my.conf # scripted (see install/install.conf.example)
```

What the installer does:
- Installs Node.js, Python, Flatpak, Plasma and the drivers your GPU needs
- Installs the emulators and apps you ticked — each one from its own
  [catalogue pack](#adding-an-emulator-or-an-app), nothing is hardcoded
- Creates a Python virtual environment and installs backend dependencies
- Builds the React frontend, installs Node modules for Electron
- Creates the Linux user you named (or reuses it if it exists)
- Configures SDDM auto-login into that user's **KDE Plasma X11 session**, with
  the GameCore kiosk drawn over it
- Registers two systemd services: `gamecore-backend` and `gamecore-ui`
- The machine boots straight into GameCore after a reboot

Closing GameCore from Settings → Desktop drops you on that Plasma desktop. To
keep the desktop across reboots — and put the kiosk back later:

```bash
sudo gamecore-session-select desktop     # kiosk off, it stops starting at boot
sudo gamecore-session-select gamecore    # kiosk back on
gamecore-session-select status           # which mode, and the sessions available
```

There is one session, so this changes no login configuration: it enables or
disables `gamecore-ui.service`, nothing else.

Verify an install from the outside — it changes nothing:

```bash
bash /opt/GameCore/scripts/check-install.sh
```

After installation:
```bash
sudo reboot
```

---

## Uninstallation

```bash
sudo bash /opt/GameCore/install/uninstall.sh --dry-run   # show everything it would do
sudo bash /opt/GameCore/install/uninstall.sh             # do it
```

The installer records what it changed in `/var/lib/gamecore/`, and the uninstaller
reads that manifest — so it only undoes what **this** box's install actually did.
A package that was already present is never removed, a user account that predated
GameCore is never deleted, and an emulator config that existed before is *restored*
from its `.bak-preinstall` backup rather than deleted.

By default it removes the services, the auto-login, the sudoers and udev rules, the
Caddy configuration and its root CA, the companion checkouts in `/opt`, the stored
web password, and the application files — and **keeps your ROMs** (`emu/`) and
`config/`.

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--dry-run` | Print every action, change nothing. Run this first. |
| `--purge` | Also delete `emu/` (ROMs) and `config/`. |
| `--remove-flatpaks` | Uninstall the Flatpak emulators **this install** added. Their save data in `~/.var/app/` is **kept** — the uninstaller never passes `--delete-data`. Remove it yourself with `flatpak uninstall --delete-data <app-id>`. |
| `--remove-packages` | `pacman -Rns` the packages this install added and that nothing else requires. |
| `--remove-user` | Delete the GameCore user — only if the manifest proves the installer created it. |
| `--yes` | No confirmation prompts. |
| `--user` / `--path` | Override the auto-detected user and install directory. |

Two things it cannot undo, and says so at the end: the `pacman -Syu` the installer
ran, and the in-place rewrite of `config/systems.json` / `config/apps.json`.

`sshd`, `bluetooth` and `sddm` are left enabled — they are system services that
almost certainly predate GameCore. The installer did enable SSH, so close it
yourself if you want it closed: `sudo systemctl disable --now sshd`.

## Development setup

> For development on your own machine — no auto-start, no kiosk mode.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/p4v1c/GamecoreRenew.git
cd GamecoreRenew

# 1. Backend
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
# Loopback only — the core has no authentication of its own, and
# docs/SECURITY.md phase 1 is "only :8443 listens on the LAN".
uvicorn backend.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765 --reload

# 2. Frontend (separate terminal)
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
# → http://localhost:5173

# 3. Electron (separate terminal)
cd electron && npm install
ELECTRON_DEV=1 npx electron .

# Tests — see docs/TESTING.md
pip install pytest
pytest backend/tests -q -m "not network"    # what CI runs
```

`DEBUG = True` in `backend/config.py` and `const DEBUG = true` in `electron/main.js` enable:
- DevTools window (detached)
- Dev URLs (localhost:5173 for frontend, localhost:8765 for backend)
- Verbose logging
- No kiosk / fullscreen lock

Set both to `false` before deploying to a device.

---

## First launch

On first boot the splash screen appears, then the **Home** screen.

- **Home** — shows your recently played games and quick-launch apps
- **Library** — full list of all systems and their ROMs, navigate with the D-pad

If no ROMs are found, the library will be empty until you add some (see below).

---

## Adding ROMs

ROMs are stored in `emu/<system_id>/` folders (e.g. `emu/melonds/`, `emu/dolphin/`).

**Option 1 — ROM Manager addon (recommended)**  
The ROM Manager ships as an addon (installed by default by the installer —
or run `gamecore-addon install rom-manager`). From any device on the same
network, open a browser and go to:
```
https://<device-ip>:8443/roms/
```
The addon itself listens only on `127.0.0.1:8770` — every LAN request goes
through Caddy on `:8443`, which asks for the shared password first. `:8770` is
not reachable from another machine.
Select a system in the left sidebar, then drag & drop your ROM files.  
They are uploaded directly to the correct folder on the device.

**Option 2 — Copy directly**  
Copy ROM files into the matching `emu/<system_id>/` folder via USB or SSH.

**Supported formats per system:**

The scanner filters strictly on this list — a format that is not declared is not
shown, with no message. `config/systems.json` is the source of truth and is
regenerated from `install/generated/systems.json.dist` on every install;
`backend/tests/test_systems_extensions.py` pins this table to it.

| System | Folder | Extensions |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| GameCube / Wii | `emu/dolphin/` | `.iso` `.gcm` `.rvz` `.wbfs` `.wad` `.zip` |
| PlayStation | `emu/duckstation/` | `.bin` `.iso` `.img` `.cue` `.chd` `.pbp` `.zip` |
| PlayStation 2 | `emu/pcsx2/` | `.iso` `.bin` `.chd` `.zip` |
| PlayStation 3 | `emu/rpcs3/` | disc-game **folders** (scanned as directories). Updates/DLC are `.pkg`, installed via the RPCS3 manager addon |
| PlayStation 4 | `emu/shadps4/` | game **folders** (scanned as directories) |
| PlayStation Portable | `emu/ppsspp/` | `.iso` `.cso` `.pbp` `.zip` |
| Wii U | `emu/cemu/` | `.wux` `.rpx` `.iso` `.zip` |
| Nintendo Switch | `emu/ryujinx/` | `.xci` `.nsp` `.zip` |
| Nintendo 3DS | `emu/azahar/` | `.3ds` `.cia` `.zip` |
| Nintendo DS | `emu/melonds/` | `.nds` `.zip` |
| Game Boy Advance | `emu/mgba/` | `.gba` `.gbc` `.gb` `.zip` |
| Nintendo 64 | `emu/gopher64/` | `.n64` `.z64` `.v64` `.zip` |
| Xbox 360 | `emu/xenia/` | `.iso` `.xex` |

> A multi-track PS1 dump is `Game.cue` plus its `Game (Track NN).bin` files.
> Launch the **`.cue`** — it is the one that knows about the other tracks.
> Starting `Track 01.bin` on its own boots the game without its CD audio.

## Controller navigation

GameCore is designed for full gamepad control — no mouse or keyboard needed.

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| D-pad / Left stick | Navigate menus |
| A / Cross | Confirm / Launch game |
| B / Circle | Back |
| Start / Options | Open Settings |
| Guide / PS button | Kill current game and return home |
| Select / Share | Open Power menu |

Inside a game, press the **Guide button** at any time to exit and return to GameCore.

---

## Settings & Wi-Fi

Open Settings from the top-right icon or press **Start** on the controller.

- **Wi-Fi** — scan and connect to networks
- **Audio** — volume control
- **Bluetooth** — pair controllers
- **Themes** — change the look of the whole UI
- **Update** — check for and apply OTA updates
- **System** — reboot / shutdown

---

## Themes

Picking a theme swaps the frontend. Drop a folder in `config/themes/`, select it
in **Settings → Themes**, and the launcher is redrawn — boot animation,
dashboard, library, menus, the lot.

```
config/themes/my-theme/
  theme.json        manifest: id, version, api, provides
  index.js          entry — a native ES module, no build step
  theme.css         your own styles
  views/  lib/      one feature per file
```

A theme is **all or nothing**: it must provide both surfaces, `splash` and
`shell`. Anything less does not load — the picker says so and the default UI
runs whole. There is no half-themed state to debug.

It changes the UI, never the behaviour. Paging, focus, sorting, search,
launching, the shutdown confirmation and the live controller diagram stay with
the launcher and are handed to a theme as data. A themed dashboard cannot
navigate differently from the default one, because it has no code that could.

If a theme crashes, the default frontend takes over and the crash is recorded;
after the second crash the theme is refused at boot, with the reason in Settings
(`CRASH_LIMIT` in `frontend/src/lib/themeSafety.ts`).
**Holding L1 + R1 for 2s in the menu** forces the default theme back — the way out
of a theme that makes the UI unusable.

An update installs themes it finds missing and **never touches a theme already
on the box** — edit a bundled one and your edits survive. The flip side: to pick
up a new version of a bundled theme, delete its folder and update again. Your
selection survives updates and reboots either way.

Start from `config/themes/_skeleton` — copy it, drop the leading underscore
(that prefix marks a template and keeps it out of the picker), and it loads.

**Full contract:** [`docs/themes/README.md`](docs/themes/README.md) —
surfaces, the SDK, the safety model, performance budget.
**Writing one with an AI:** [`docs/themes/PROMPTS.md`](docs/themes/PROMPTS.md).

---

## Addons

Optional modules live in [p4v1c/gamecore-addons](https://github.com/p4v1c/gamecore-addons)
and are managed with one command:

```
gamecore-addon install <name>     # e.g. rom-manager
gamecore-addon list
gamecore-addon update
gamecore-addon remove <name>
```

Each addon runs as its own service on its own port (8770-8799) and shows a
shared nav bar linking every installed web addon — it all feels like one site.
The core only exposes the registry (`GET /api/addons`) and a WebSocket relay
(`POST /api/addons/notify`); it knows nothing about addon internals.

---

## Overlays (bezels)

Overlays are decorative frames displayed on top of the emulator window.  
They fill the black bars that appear on 4:3 and other non-16:9 systems.

> Overlays only work on **X11 sessions** (the installer uses KDE Plasma on X11).  
> On Wayland dev environments, overlays are silently skipped. This includes the
> in-game measurement below — there is no capture path on Wayland.

### One bezel per game

A bezel is looked up for the game first and for the system second:

```
assets/overlays/<system_id>/<Game Name (Region)>.png   ← this game
assets/overlays/<system_id>.png                        ← the whole system
                                                       ← otherwise nothing
```

The per-game directory is named the way Bezel Project packs are, i.e. the way
No-Intro and Redump name dumps. Region, revision, disc and language tags are
ignored on both sides, so `Final Fantasy VII (USA) (Disc 1).chd` finds
`Final Fantasy VII (USA).png`, and a European library finds an American pack.

**A game with no bezel at all gets no frame** — not black bars from a
rectangle nobody measured.

Press **R2** on a game in the library to pick a specific bezel or turn the
overlay off for that game alone.

Coverage in the Bezel Project repositories is uneven: strong on PSX, N64, GBA
and arcade, weak to absent on PS2, GameCube and 3DS. The five 16:9 systems
(PS3, PS4, Switch, Wii U, Xbox 360) have no black bars and need no overlay.

### Uploading an overlay

From the ROM Manager addon (`https://<device-ip>:8443/roms/`):  
Select a system → click the **Overlay** button → drag & drop or browse for a PNG.

Or copy the PNG directly to:
```
assets/overlays/<system_id>.png
```

### The hole is measured for you

The transparent region is read out of the PNG's alpha channel at launch, so the
`hole` in `config/overlays.json` no longer has to be kept in sync by hand — it
is only the fallback frame for a system with no PNG at all. Drop in a bezel cut
for any resolution and the hole follows.

A second after a game starts, GameCore also checks that the emulator really
draws where the hole says it does, and corrects it once per system and ratio if
not. Nothing is corrected unless two samples agree and the result looks like
letterboxing — a measurement taken during a loading screen is discarded rather
than believed.

### Creating an overlay with ImageMagick

**Install ImageMagick:**
```bash
sudo pacman -S imagemagick
```

The overlay must be a **1920×1080 PNG** with a **transparent hole** where the game screen appears.

> ⚠️ Do **not** use the old `-region … -alpha transparent` recipe: on ImageMagick 7 it
> silently does nothing and produces a fully opaque overlay (the game is then
> completely hidden). Punch the hole with a `DstOut` composite instead:

```bash
magick your_image.png \
  -background "rgb(0,0,0)" -flatten \
  -resize 1920x1080! \
  \( -size <W>x<H> xc:black \) -geometry +<X>+<Y> -compose DstOut -composite \
  assets/overlays/<system_id>.png
```

**Hole dimensions per system** (emulators render the native aspect ratio centered at full screen height):

| System | Native ratio | Hole `<W>x<H>` at `+<X>+<Y>` | Black bars |
|--------|-------------|------------------------------|-----------|
| GameCube / Wii (`dolphin`) | 4:3 | `1440x1080` at `+240+0` | 240px each side |
| PlayStation 1 (`duckstation`) | 4:3 minus PS1 overscan | `1440x968` at `+240+52` | 240px sides, 52px top, 60px bottom |
| PlayStation 2 (`pcsx2`) | 4:3 | `1440x1080` at `+240+0` | 240px each side |
| Nintendo 64 (`gopher64`, Rosalie's Mupen GUI) | measured, not 4:3 | `1407x888` at `+258+90` | 258px sides, 90px top, 102px bottom |
| Game Boy Advance (`mgba`) | 3:2 (240×160) | `1620x1080` at `+150+0` | 150px each side |
| Nintendo DS (`melonds`) | 2:3 vertical (2 stacked screens) | `720x1080` at `+600+0` | 600px each side |
| Nintendo 3DS (`azahar`) | Stacked (Top 5:3, Bot 4:3) | Two holes (see below) | Variable |

> **Nintendo 64 does not follow the 4:3 rule.** Rosalie's Mupen GUI draws
> 1407x888 at +258+90 on a 1080p screen — measured with `spectacle`, not
> derived. Its window is 1920x1080 and it paints black around that picture, so
> the bezel has to open exactly on the picture, not on a 4:3 rectangle.
> When in doubt for any emulator, measure rather than assume: launch the game
> with no overlay, screenshot, and find the non-black bounding box.

> **16:9 systems** (PS3, PS4, PSP, Wii U, Switch, Xbox 360) fill the entire screen — no black bars, no overlay needed.
> Keep `config/overlays.json` `hole` values in sync with the PNG — the JSON hole is the fallback frame used when the PNG is missing.

**Example — PlayStation 2 / Nintendo 64 / GameCube (full-height 4:3):**
```bash
magick artwork.png \
  -background "rgb(0,0,0)" -flatten \
  -resize 1920x1080! \
  \( -size 1440x1080 xc:black \) -geometry +240+0 -compose DstOut -composite \
  assets/overlays/pcsx2.png     # or gopher64.png / dolphin.png
```

**Example — PlayStation 1 (DuckStation):**

PS1 video output carries its own black overscan bands (slightly off-center: more at
the bottom than the top), so the hole is a bit shorter than full 4:3 and shifted down:

```bash
magick artwork.png \
  -background "rgb(0,0,0)" -flatten \
  -resize 1920x1080! \
  \( -size 1440x968 xc:black \) -geometry +240+52 -compose DstOut -composite \
  assets/overlays/duckstation.png
```

Measured with `AspectRatio = 4:3` in DuckStation. If your games show a different frame,
measure it yourself: take a screenshot in game, then

```bash
magick screenshot.png -resize 1920x1080! -crop 1x1080+960+0 +repage \
  -colorspace gray -threshold 10% -negate -format "%@" info:
```

prints the black band geometry on the centre column — use the bright area's `HxW+X+Y`
as your hole. Mirroring it into `config/overlays.json` is optional now: the hole
is measured from the PNG at launch, and the JSON value is only the fallback for
a system with no PNG. Keep them in step anyway if you edit one — the test suite
checks that the shipped bezels and their declared holes agree.

**Example — Game Boy Advance (3:2):**
```bash
magick mgba.jpg \
  -background "rgb(0,0,0)" -flatten \
  -resize 1920x1080! \
  \( -size 1620x1080 xc:black \) -geometry +150+0 -compose DstOut -composite \
  assets/overlays/mgba.png
```

**Example — Nintendo DS (stacked screens):**
```bash
magick mario_background.png \
  -background "rgb(0,0,0)" -flatten \
  -resize 1920x1080! \
  \( -size 720x1080 xc:black \) -geometry +600+0 -compose DstOut -composite \
  assets/overlays/melonds.png
```

**Example — Nintendo 3DS (two stacked holes):**
```bash
magick artwork.png \
  -background "rgb(0,0,0)" -flatten \
  -resize 1920x1080! \
  \( -size 900x540 xc:black \) -geometry +510+0   -compose DstOut -composite \
  \( -size 720x540 xc:black \) -geometry +600+540 -compose DstOut -composite \

## Cover art and game media

Covers are resolved per game through a tiered pipeline — each tier is only
tried if the previous one found nothing:

1. **Local cache / manual override** — `emu/covers/<system>/<name>.png|.jpg`.
   Drop an image there to force a cover for a game.
2. **Icon embedded in the game itself** (offline, always exact):
   PS3 folders (`PS3_GAME/ICON0.PNG`), PS4 folders (`sce_sys/icon0.png`),
   PSP ISOs (`PSP_GAME/ICON0.PNG` read straight out of the ISO).
   Titles shown in the library also come from the game's `PARAM.SFO`
   for PS3/PS4, so serial-named folders display their real name.
3. **ScreenScraper / LaunchBox** — the ROM's **file hash** (CRC32+MD5+SHA1)
   when it is a real file, so a renamed or mistagged cartridge still lands on
   the right game; the `PARAM.SFO` title for PS3/PS4/PSP folders; the filename
   otherwise. This is also where the other 53 media types come from — see
   below. Needs credentials (or the offline LaunchBox index); skipped
   entirely when neither is configured.
4. **Exact disc-ID lookup** — the ID is read from the image header
   (GameCube/Wii `.iso/.gcm/.rvz`) or from `SYSTEM.CNF` inside the disc
   (PS1/PS2), then fetched from **GameTDB** (GC/Wii/PS3) or the
   **xlenore psx/ps2 cover repos**. No filename guessing involved.
5. **Name-based scraping** — the **libretro thumbnails CDN**, then
   **TheGamesDB** (needs an API key, see below).

Failed lookups are cached for a week (`.miss` files) so browsing the
library stays fast offline. Append `?refresh=1` to a
`/api/covers/<system>/<file>` request to force a re-resolve (e.g. after
renaming a ROM or getting internet back).

### Beyond the jacket — `/api/media`

A game has up to **54 media types**: 3D box, clear logo, gameplay screenshot,
title screen, ready-made mixes, trailer, manual, cartridge art, bezels.

```bash
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:8765/api/media/rpcs3/BCES00509' | jq .media
# → { "box-3d": {"category":"box","kind":"image","region":"eu","cached":false}, … }

# and the file itself
curl -o box3d.png 'http://127.0.0.1:8765/api/media/rpcs3/BCES00509/media/box-3d'
```

**The default themes are unaffected**: they draw the jacket, from `/api/covers`,
exactly as before. This exists so a theme *can* be built on 3D boxes or
screenshots — see [`docs/themes/README.md` §7.1](docs/themes/README.md).

Nothing is downloaded before it is asked for. A scrape fetches the cover and
records the rest; the first request for a 3D box is one HTTP call and costs no
ScreenScraper quota.

### Enable ScreenScraper (best identification)

ScreenScraper needs **two accounts**, and they are not the same thing:

| | |
|---|---|
| **developer** | asked for on the [ScreenScraper forum](https://www.screenscraper.fr), granted per piece of software. The dev id is the **pseudonym**, not the number in the `devinfos.php` URL. Without it: `403` |
| **member** | your own account on screenscraper.fr. It carries the daily quota and the number of threads you may use |

The installer asks for both. To add them afterwards:

```bash
sudo systemctl edit gamecore-backend.service
```

```
[Service]
Environment="SCREENSCRAPER_DEV_ID=your_dev_pseudonym"
Environment="SCREENSCRAPER_DEV_PASSWORD=your_dev_password"
Environment="SCREENSCRAPER_USER=your_member_login"
Environment="SCREENSCRAPER_PASSWORD=your_member_password"
```

```bash
sudo systemctl restart gamecore-backend.service
```

> The developer credential is **shared by every box running GameCore**. That is
> why requests are spaced 1.2 s apart and never committed to the repo: exceeding
> the rate gets the id blacklisted for everyone, not just you.

**Or no account at all**: LaunchBox publishes its metadata dump, 185 000 games
with 172 000 synopses, and it works offline once indexed.

```bash
cd /opt/GameCore && .venv/bin/python backend/services/gamemedia/gamescrape.py --refresh
```

That downloads 106 MB, indexes for about 25 s and leaves a 234 MB SQLite file in
`emu/gamescrape/`. The backend never builds it on its own — 106 MB of download
from inside an HTTP handler would block the request for minutes.

### Enable TheGamesDB (recommended)

1. Register for a free API key at **https://thegamesdb.net**
2. Add the key to the backend service:

```bash
sudo systemctl edit gamecore-backend.service
```

In the editor, add:

```
[Service]
Environment=THEGAMESDB_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

Then restart:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart gamecore-backend.service
```

TheGamesDB covers PS3, Switch, Nintendo 64, DS, GBA, PSP, PS1, PS2, GameCube, Wii U, and 3DS.
If no key is set, the scraper silently falls back to libretro only.

## Standby

After a configurable idle time (Settings → Standby), GameCore shows a
cover-art screensaver, then turns the screen off via DPMS and drops the
CPU governor to powersave. The box itself stays up: backend, SSH and OTA
updates keep working. **Any controller button wakes it** (evdev-based, so
it works even with the UI asleep); mouse/keyboard input works too. A
running game always blocks standby.

Governor switching is optional and needs a sudoers rule (the screen is
the real power sink — skip this if you don't care):

```
# /etc/sudoers.d/gamecore-standby
your_user ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/cpupower frequency-set -g powersave, /usr/bin/cpupower frequency-set -g performance
```

---

## OTA updates

Via the UI: **Settings → Update → Check for update → Install**

Or manually on the device:
```bash
bash update/linux.sh
```

The update pulls the latest release from GitHub, replaces app files in place (preserving ROMs, `config/`, and emulators), rebuilds the frontend, then restarts the services through a detached `gamecore-restart.service` unit. That last step needs a one-time root setup:

```bash
sudo install/steps/setup-update-permissions.sh
```

This installs the restart unit and a sudoers rule allowing the GameCore user to start **only** that unit — the update itself runs unprivileged, from the UI, with progress streamed to the settings screen.

---

## Adding an emulator or an app

**One directory is one system or one application.** Everything it needs lives in
`catalog/<id>/`, and nothing about it is written anywhere else — not in
`install/arch.sh`, not in the installer wizard, not in the tile catalogues.
Adding one is dropping a directory; removing one is `rm -rf`.

```
catalog/myemu/
├── pack.json        the declaration — the only required file
├── logo.png         the tile
├── seed/            curated config, deployed to the emulator's config dir
├── generator.py     controller bindings (optional)
└── tests/           this pack's own tests, run by CI with the rest
```

A minimal emulator:

```json
{
  "id": "myemu",
  "kind": "emulator",
  "label": "Some Console",
  "emulatorName": "MyEmu",
  "platform": "SOMECONSOLE",
  "family": "Sega",
  "color": "#1e90ff",
  "order": 13,
  "install": { "provider": "flatpak", "appIds": ["org.example.MyEmu"] },
  "launch": { "path": "flatpak", "args": "run @APPID@ --fullscreen" },
  "roms": { "dir": "emu/myemu", "extensions": ["*.bin", "*.zip"] }
}
```

Then, from the repository root:

```bash
python3 scripts/check-catalog.py    # validate against the schema
python3 scripts/gen-catalog.py      # regenerate the three derived files
git add catalog/myemu install/
```

**`gen-catalog.py` is not optional.** Three committed files are generated from
the packs: `install/generated/systems.json.dist` and `install/generated/apps.json.dist` (the tile
catalogues the installer copies into `config/`) and
`install/installer-gui/catalog_data.py` (the wizard's tick-box list — the wizard
is a standalone binary that runs *before* the repository is on the machine, so
its list is baked in at build time). Skip it and your pack validates, appears in
no tick box, is never selected, and never installs. CI runs
`gen-catalog.py --check` and fails the build if the committed copies are stale.

An **app** is the same file with `"kind": "app"`, plus whatever it needs beside
it — `sources` for git checkouts, `files` for configs (with `@HOME@` and secret
tokens), `services` for a systemd user unit, `postInstall` for the steps that do
not reduce to data. `catalog/twitch/` is the worked example: it installs EmberTV
end to end, including generating a TLS certificate and trusting it in a Firefox
profile.

Emulators that are not on Flathub are just a different `install` provider —
`github-asset` for an AppImage (DuckStation), `github-archive` for a zip
(Xenia). Both carry checksum, magic-byte and retry protections for free.

## Living-room box setup

How the reference box is wired together. GameCore runs from `/opt/GameCore` with two **system** units:

| Unit | Role |
|---|---|
| `gamecore-backend.service` | FastAPI backend (uvicorn, port **8765**). `Environment=GAMECORE_PATH=/opt/GameCore`. Scraper credentials — the TheGamesDB key and the four ScreenScraper values — live in a local drop-in (`systemctl edit gamecore-backend`, mode 600), never in the repo. |
| `gamecore-ui.service` | Electron shell (`electron/start-ui.sh`), started after the display manager. |

Two companion projects handle TV input and Twitch. **A `--full` install sets both up
automatically** — it clones them, installs their user services, and prompts for the
Twitch Client ID/Secret, the TheGamesDB API key and the ScreenScraper credentials
(secrets are written to local files/systemd drop-ins only, never to git; leave empty
for demo mode and name-based covers). It also creates
the Firefox kiosk profiles for the YouTube/Twitch tiles and installs Stremio. The only
manual step left after a full install is copying BIOS/firmwares (PS1/PS2/PS3, DS/3DS,
Switch keys) — those can't be distributed.

For reference, what the installer wires up:

- **[gamepad-tv-bridge](https://github.com/p4v1c/gamepad-tv-bridge)** — daemon translating gamepad input to keyboard events for apps that don't speak gamepad (Firefox kiosk, EmberTV…). Cloned in `/opt/gamepad-tv-bridge`, installed editable in `~/.venv` (`pip install -e .`), runs as the **user** unit `gamepad-tv-bridge.service` (`WantedBy=default.target`, so linger starts it at boot rather than at graphical login). Per-app YAML profiles in `profiles/` (window-title matching). It is wired by `arch.sh`, not by a pack: it serves both the YouTube and the Twitch kiosk, so it belongs to neither.
- **[Twitch-TV / EmberTV](https://github.com/p4v1c/Twitch-TV)** — controller-first Twitch client, installed entirely from `catalog/twitch/`: the checkout in `/opt/Twitch-TV` (`sources`), `config.json` rendered from a template with your Client ID/Secret — or a demo config when you leave them empty (`files`), the **user** unit `embertv.service` on HTTPS **8097** (`services`), then the TLS certificate generated and trusted in the Firefox kiosk profile's NSS database (`postInstall`). GameCore's Twitch tile opens `https://localhost:8097`.

Apps launched from GameCore that need gamepad access inside Flatpak (e.g. Stremio) use `"gamepadTrigger": true` in `config/apps.json`, which re-triggers udev after launch (requires `NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/udevadm` in sudoers).

The Stremio tile runs the **official Flatpak desktop client**, unmodified. All it lacked for couch use was an on-screen keyboard, so a small local proxy serves Stremio's own web interface with a keyboard script injected — no fork, no browser kiosk, no host-side node or `ffmpeg` transcoding. See [`docs/STREMIO.md`](docs/STREMIO.md).

assets/           logos/, overlays/
emu/              ROMs per system (emu/dolphin/, emu/melonds/…), covers/ cache,
                  gamemedia/ manifests + artwork, gamescrape/ LaunchBox index
catalog/          THE source of truth — one directory per emulator or app:
                  pack.json (declaration), logo.png, seed/ (curated config),
                  generator.py (controller bindings), files/ + steps/ (what the
                  install writes and runs), tests/. See docs/architecture/10.
  _schema/        pack.schema.json — what check-catalog.py validates against
install/          arch.sh (the engine, + --unattended) and uninstall.sh at the
                  root; everything else grouped by what it IS:
  bin/            installed into /usr/local/bin — gamecore-addon, -emu,
                  -launcher, -session-select, -xsetup, -firstboot
  system/         installed into /etc — Caddyfile, gamecore-restart.service,
                  gamecore-firstboot.service
  steps/          called by arch.sh, never installed on the box
  generated/      apps.json.dist, systems.json.dist — written by
                  scripts/gen-catalog.py, never hand-edited
  installer-gui/  the Qt wizard + its PyInstaller .spec
  iso/            the archiso profile for the installation ISO — profiledef.sh,
                  packages.x86_64 (a superset of arch.sh's package list, checked
                  by backend/tests/test_iso_profile.py), the boot menus, and
                  airootfs/ with the live session. build.sh is the one command
                  that builds an image; gamecore-disk-install.sh is the guided
                  partitioner and refuses to run anywhere but a booted ISO.
