"""Every repo path the documentation names must still exist — or be declared.

This does NOT check that the docs are *right*. No script can: a document can
name every file correctly and still explain the system backwards. What it
catches is the failure mode that actually happens here — a file gets renamed or
moved, and the document naming it keeps saying the old thing, confidently, for
months. Doc rot is silent and the rest of the baseline is blind to it.

Two things are verified:

  1. inline-code tokens that look like repo paths (`backend/services/paths.py`,
     with an optional `:123` or `:symbol()` citation suffix) resolve on disk;
  2. relative Markdown links between documents resolve.

The allowlists below are the interesting part
----------------------------------------------
The first version of this script flagged 24 references and **every single one
was a false positive**, in two distinct ways. Both are worth naming, because
both are things this repository does on purpose:

Existence is resolved against `git ls-files`, **not against the disk.** The first
version asked the filesystem and so passed on this machine and failed in CI:
`frontend/dist` and `lib/` exist once you have built and installed, and exist
nowhere in a fresh clone. A checker whose answer depends on which machine runs it
reports the machine, not the docs.

`NOT_IN_GIT` / `RUNTIME_GENERATED` — build output, and the box's own state.
`config/` is the box's identity: it is not in git and several of its files are
written on first boot, so a checkout legitimately has no `config/auth_secret`.
Skipping all of `config/` would have been the easy fix and the wrong one: then a
document could invent `config/setttings.json` and nothing would notice. So each
is listed by name, and a new one has to be added deliberately.

`HISTORICAL` — this repo documents *what failure produced a rule*, which means
its best paragraphs name files that no longer exist:

    "a refactor deleted `install/firefox-profiles/` while `arch.sh` still
     read it. That install died at 66 %, on a fresh machine, months later."

That sentence is correct precisely because the directory is gone. A checker that
forces such prose to be deleted would strip the documentation of the only part
that cannot be recovered by reading the code. So those paths are listed too,
with the reason.

`NOT_YET` — a file a document names *because it is missing*: the catalogue
signing key, whose absence is what keeps the update channel off. Delete the entry
when the file lands, and the normal check takes over — the doc is then verified
rather than excused.

If you add an entry to any of the three, say why. A list of bare paths becomes a
place to silence this script, which is the opposite of the point.

Run:  python3 scripts/check-docs.py [--all]
      --all also scans docs/*.md, not just docs/architecture/.
