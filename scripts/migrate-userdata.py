    scripts/migrate-userdata.py --to /userdata --i-know-what-i-am-doing

This moves somebody's ROM library, their saves' neighbours, their playtime and
their credentials. It is the most destructive thing in the repository, so it is
built to be hard to fire by accident and impossible to fire by surprise:

  · **Dry run by default.** No flag, no writes. The plan goes to the terminal
    and a human reads it before anything happens.
  · **It copies. It never deletes, and never overwrites.** The originals stay
    exactly where they are, so a migration that turns out wrong costs disk
    space and nothing else. Deleting the old copy is a separate decision, made
    later, by a person who has seen the box work.
  · **No default destination.** `--to` is required. There is no way to run this
    bare and have it do something.
  · **Nothing calls it.** Not `update/linux.sh`, not an `install/steps/` script
    the OTA invokes, not the backend at startup, not a systemd unit. It is a
    command a human types, and `backend/tests/test_migration.py` fails the
    build if that ever stops being true.

Why it does not finish the job
------------------------------
Copying the bytes is not the migration. The box only starts reading the new
tree once `GAMECORE_DATA` is set in the backend's systemd unit, and this script
does not touch that either — it prints what to do and stops. Two reversible
steps with a human between them, rather than one irreversible one.

That ordering is deliberate: the pointer moved first (the release that split
the paths defaults `GAMECORE_DATA` to the installation, so nothing changed),
and the bytes move here, later, by hand.

    """

    1. Point both units at it — a drop-in each, so the installer's own files
       and any THEGAMESDB key in override.conf are left exactly as they are:
         sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/gamecore-backend.service.d \\
                       /etc/systemd/system/gamecore-ui.service.d

         printf '[Service]\\nEnvironment=GAMECORE_DATA={d}\\n' \\
           | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/gamecore-ui.service.d/userdata.conf

    2. The addon CLI in /usr/local/bin is a copy only the installer refreshes.
       Put the one this release ships there (the old one does not know
       GAMECORE_DATA and would bake the old root into every addon's unit):
         sudo install -m 755 {src_root}/install/bin/gamecore-addon /usr/local/bin/gamecore-addon

    3. Restart the core so the units take effect:
         sudo systemctl daemon-reload
         sudo systemctl restart gamecore-backend gamecore-ui

    4. Re-run the addon installers: the CLI now reads GAMECORE_DATA from the
       backend's unit and rewrites each addon's unit with it —
         gamecore-addon update

    5. Check, before playing anything:
         systemctl show gamecore-backend -p Environment --value | tr ' ' '\\n' | grep GAMECORE_DATA
         grep GAMECORE_DATA ~/.config/systemd/user/gamecore-addon-*.service
       Both must say {d}. Then the library, the settings, the overlays and
       an upload from ROM Manager, on the TV.

    6. Only then, and only by hand, delete the old copies under
         {src_root}
       (on btrfs the copy was a reflink: deleting the old side frees nothing
       until the new side diverges — read `btrfs filesystem du`, not `du`).

  The way back, at any point before step 6:
         sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/gamecore-backend.service.d/userdata.conf \\
                 /etc/systemd/system/gamecore-ui.service.d/userdata.conf
         sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl restart gamecore-backend gamecore-ui
         gamecore-addon update
  and the box reads {src_root} again, exactly as before — nothing there was touched.
