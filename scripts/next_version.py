"""The next release tag, under a bounded version scheme.

    usage:  next_version.py [previous-tag]

Reads the previous tag from the argument, or from `git describe` when none is
given, and prints the tag the next release should carry.

## The scheme

Three fields, each with a ceiling: **major ≤ 99, minor ≤ 9, patch ≤ 99**, so the
highest version this project can express is `99.9.99`. Every release bumps the
patch; when a field would pass its ceiling it carries into the one above, the
way an odometer does.

The point is that a version stays four or five characters wide and stays
readable on a television at three metres. `v1.0.182` was heading for `v1.0.1000`
— a number nobody can compare at a glance, in a UI where the version is a line
in a settings screen rather than something you look up.

## Ordering is preserved, which is the part that matters

Every consumer of these numbers compares them as a tuple of three integers —
`routers/update.py:_version_int`, `update/linux.sh:key()`, the theme delivery
loop. A carry keeps that ordering: `1.0.182` normalises to `1.1.82`, and
`(1, 1, 82) > (1, 0, 182)` because the comparison is left to right, not by
magnitude of the last field. So a box running the old numbering still sees the
first new-scheme release as an update, with no migration and no special case.

## The first run migrates by itself

`next()` normalises the previous tag before bumping. When normalising alone
already produces a greater version — which is exactly the case for a tag left
over from the unbounded scheme — that is the next tag, and no bump is added on
top. `v1.0.182` therefore becomes `v1.1.82` rather than `v1.1.83`, and every
run after that behaves ordinarily.

## Overflow is refused, not wrapped

At `99.9.99` there is no next version, and this exits non-zero rather than
inventing `100.0.0` — a number the scheme cannot express, that would sort below
everything after a two-digit parse, and that would silently stop every box in
the field from ever seeing another update. It is roughly 100 000 releases away;
the check costs nothing and the failure mode it prevents is the worst one here.
