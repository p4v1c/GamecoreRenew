Paths are NOT derived here any more. `services/paths.py` owns the two roots —
the installation (code, read-only) and the data (writable) — and this module
re-exports the handful of names the backend has always imported from it, so
that a consumer keeps one import and the split stays in one file.

What is left here is genuinely configuration: version, ports, credentials,
