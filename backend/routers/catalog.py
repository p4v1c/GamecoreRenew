"""The catalogue, and installing from it while the box is running.

Same shape as routers/addons.py, deliberately: one CLI action at a time behind
`_busy_lock`, output pumped line by line onto the existing WebSocket, and the
task handle — not the lock — as the busy check.

The core stays thin. It knows the catalogue is a directory of packs and drives
`gamecore-emu`; it knows nothing about what an emulator is.

**Why the ids are validated here and not only in the CLI.** This endpoint is
reachable from the LAN interface (behind forward_auth) and the CLI runs with
enough privilege to install software. `id` goes into an argv, never into a
shell, and it must match a pack the catalogue already declares — there is no
"install this URL". A pack comes from the release or the operator drops it in
config/catalog.d/, and one dropped there is data only.
