"""Per-game settings, from the sofa.

Three things the options panel needs and cannot work out for itself:

  · what this game IS. The id comes out of the dump — a PARAM.SFO, a disc
    header, a meta.xml — and the frontend has no business opening game files.
  · whether the emulator supports this at all, and if not, the pack's own
    sentence saying why. An empty panel and an impossible feature look
    identical from a sofa, and only one of them is worth investigating.
  · whether a shipped profile is in place, and whether the player has taken it
    off. Three states, not two: "applied", "refused", and "exists but this box
    runs an emulator the profile does not claim to cover".

There is deliberately no endpoint for editing an individual setting. GameCore
does not know what a setting MEANS, and a screen that offered `Video` /
`Write Color Buffers` / `true` as three text boxes would be a config file
editor on a television. The button opens the emulator's own window instead,
and everything the player sets there GameCore then keeps, per game.
