    for anything HIDAPI drives, Bluetooth included. That one byte is the
    difference between Ryujinx binding the pad and its
    `_gamepadsIds.IndexOf(id)` returning -1 and disposing the slot in silence.

    **The runtime is checked when the app ships nothing, and it is not a

    ship none and link `org.kde.Platform`'s. Returning "" for those meant "ask

    That second line is not a curiosity: `snapshots.py` records azahar writing
    `button_up = 11` for this exact pad and calls it unexplainable next to SDL's
    own mapping "which claims a hat and calls button 11 the touchpad". Both are
    true, and this is why — two SDL2 builds, two answers, and azahar's is the
    one in the runtime. Asking the host for an azahar binding produces a hat
    where azahar wants button 11: a config full of plausible numbers binding the
    wrong things, which is the failure the whole package is arranged to avoid.

    App first, runtime second, host never: the order is the specificity order,
    and an app that bundles its own SDL is not affected by any of this.

    `bundled_sdl2`'s twin, and same order — app first, runtime second — for the
    same reason: an app that ships its own library is not answered by anybody
    else's. RMG ships none and links `org.kde.Platform`'s.

    **"Host never", exactly like its twin — and this docstring used to say the
    opposite.** It claimed the host was an acceptable last resort, on the
    strength of one DualShock 4 answering identically from both builds. A
    second pad settled it, same instant, same box:

        pad                    host libSDL3 3.4.12   org.kde.Platform 6.10's
                                                     libSDL3 3.2.30 (RMG's)

                               ^^ dashes            ^^ colons

    The two builds format a DualSense's serial differently, and RMG-Input
    compares `DeviceSerial` by string equality. A profile written from the
    host's answer names a pad RMG will never recognise — the port stays empty
    and nothing says why. The DualShock 4 kept working throughout, which is
    what made a one-pad measurement look like a rule.

    So a caller that has an `app_id` must treat "" as a REFUSAL and write
    nothing, never as permission to ask the host. That is what `guid_for`
    already does for the bus byte, and this is the same lesson reached by a
    different road: a string is only comparable to itself if both sides came
    from the same library.
