"""Which game this is — the one name everything downstream files it under.

A per-game config is a file named after a game, so before anything can be
written there has to be an answer to "which game is this". That answer differs
per system in the only way that matters — where it is READ FROM — and not at
all in what it is for:

    ps3, ps4, psp   a Title ID in PARAM.SFO
    gcwii           the 6 characters at the top of a disc image
    playstation     the serial in SYSTEM.CNF
    wiiu            the title id in the dump's own meta.xml
    hash            the CRC32 of the file itself
    filename        the normalised name, and nothing else was available

The bottom two rows are why this is a registry and not a chain of `if`s. A
cartridge dump carries NO identifier: an N64, SNES or Mega Drive ROM is the
game and nothing more, so the only identity it has is the bytes. Any design
that assumed "read the id out of the dump" would work for the thirteen systems
here and then be rewritten the first time somebody added a retro console —
which is exactly the direction this catalogue keeps going.

Where the readers come from, and why they are not re-typed here
---------------------------------------------------------------
`local_media.py` already opens all five container layouts, because covers and
titles needed them first. Those parsers are the source of truth and this module
CALLS them; it does not carry a second copy of the PARAM.SFO offsets or the
WIA header layout. A ROM that scrapes as one game and configures as another is
worse than either answer being wrong on its own, and two copies of a parser is
how that happens.

What it does NOT do is go through `local_media.disc_id()`. That function
answers a different question — "what should the scraper look this up by" — and
gives PS4 and PSP no answer at all, deliberately. Reaching past it to the
per-format readers keeps this module from changing what the scraper sees.

`wiiu` is the one reader written here rather than there, and the reason is the
same rule read the other way: `localMedia` means icons and titles and online
lookups, none of which this adds for the Wii U. A format in that enum with two
of its three readers missing would be a promise the file does not keep.

Two consumers, one implementation
---------------------------------
The per-game configs are the first caller. `bezels.rom_key()` is the second and
was the first to exist — it already computed the `filename` identity, and now
delegates here so that a game cannot be one thing to its overlay and another to
its settings.
