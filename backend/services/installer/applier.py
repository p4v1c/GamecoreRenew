"""Applying what a pack declares beyond obtaining its binary.

`providers.py` answers "where does the artefact come from". This answers
everything after: the git checkouts an app needs beside it, the files it drops,
the user unit it runs under, and the two-step ceremonies (generate a cert, then
trust it) that no amount of declaration can turn into data.

    packages   → pacman, recorded in the uninstall manifest
    install    → providers.py
    sources    → git clone, or ff-only sync of an existing checkout
    files      → src verbatim, or template with the tokens below
    usb        → one udev rules file per pack, written and NOT activated
    services   → user unit + default.target.wants symlink
    postInstall→ pack-local script, as the user, bounded, never fatal

Order matters and is fixed: a file written into a checkout needs the checkout,
a unit needs its ExecStart to exist, and a post-install step needs all three.

Tokens, in `dest` and inside templates:

    @HOME@            the gaming user's home
    @USER@            the gaming user's name
    @GAMECORE_PATH@   the install directory
    @<SECRET_KEY>@    any key the pack declares under `secrets`

Two rules this module does not get to decide:

  · **Nothing here runs for a local pack.** `catalog/loader.py` strips
    `sources`, `services`, `postInstall` and `packages` from anything found in
    `config/catalog.d/` before it ever becomes a Pack, so a directory dropped on
    a box cannot reach this code. The operator lifts that with
    GAMECORE_TRUST_LOCAL_PACKS=1, and the loader logs it at every load.
  · **A pack may only read from its own directory.** `src`, `template`, `unit`
    and `run` are resolved against pack.path and rejected if they land outside
    it — that is what keeps "one directory per app" from becoming "one
    directory, plus whatever ../.. reaches".

Nothing raises. A failure costs the app its tile and says which; it never ends
the install. The Xenia block once aborted the whole installer at 52 %, and left
a machine that was neither a working install nor a clean one.
