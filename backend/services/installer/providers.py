Callable from the bash installer (scripts/gamecore-provider.py) and, later,
from the backend at runtime — the same code either way, so a hot install cannot
behave differently from a fresh one.

Every provider feeds /var/lib/gamecore/, so `uninstall.sh` keeps removing only
what GameCore actually installed.

Nothing here is fatal by itself. A provider that fails costs one tile and says
so; the install carries on. That is not politeness — the Xenia block once
aborted the whole installer at 52 %, before a single systemd unit, sudoers rule
or autologin drop-in existed, and left a machine that was neither a working
install nor a clean one.
