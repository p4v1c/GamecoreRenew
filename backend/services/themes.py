"""Theme discovery and selection.

A theme is a directory under config/themes/ holding a manifest, an ES module and
its assets. config/ is already excluded from the OTA rsync, so themes survive an
update without touching update/linux.sh.

Nothing here executes theme code — the browser imports the module. This module
only reads manifests, validates them and remembers which theme is active.
See docs/themes/README.md for the manifest contract.
