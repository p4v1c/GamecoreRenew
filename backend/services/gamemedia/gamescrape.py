"""gamescrape — every image of a game, from its ROM filename.

    python3 gamescrape.py "fifa-19-(europe)(fr,en).nds" -o output

Two sources, picked by --source (auto by default):

  LaunchBox      the official Metadata.zip dump, downloaded once then indexed
                 into SQLite under ~/.cache/gamescrape — everything is instant
                 and offline from then on. No credentials. Matches by NAME: 92 %
                 hit rate measured over 1950 ROMs, 90 % of them exact.
  ScreenScraper  matches by file HASH (CRC/MD5/SHA1): when the ROM is on disk,
                 the game found is certain even if the file is misnamed. Needs
                 DEVELOPER credentials (devid/devpassword) — see the
                 ScreenScraper section below; without them the script silently
                 fell back to LaunchBox.

Media available: 3D box, box front/back/spine, cartridge, disc, clear logo,
fanart, banner, screenshots (gameplay, title screen, game over…), flyers, arcade
marquee and cabinet, poster…

The filename is enough, the ROM need not exist: the parser strips separators,
region and language tags, disc number and revision, then infers the console from
the extension.

No dependencies: standard library only.

# ── The façade ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# This file was 1 308 lines. Four seams were already drawn in it as section
# headers, and they are now four modules:
#
#     parser.py       the ROM-name vocabulary and the parser over it
#     lb_index.py     downloading and indexing the LaunchBox dump
#     search.py       finding a game in that index, and reading its record
#     media_types.py  what a media type is called, whichever source answered
#     common.py       the constants, `out()` and `slug()` all four share
#
# What stayed is the ScreenScraper client, the downloader and the CLI — the
# parts that talk to the network with credentials, and the entry point.
#
# Everything the modules define is re-exported HERE, under the names it had
# before, because `gamemedia.py` reaches into this module as `gs.<name>` for
# some forty of them and the vendored layout is documented in
# services/gamemedia/__init__.py. A split that changed one import outside this
# package would not be a split, it would be a rewrite of its callers.
# Two import paths, and both are used. Inside the backend this is a package;
# run as `python3 gamescrape.py <rom>` — the CLI this file's own docstring
# documents — it is a loose script with no parent package. Same try/except
# gamemedia.py already uses to reach this module, rather than a second
# mechanism. It is also what the split had to preserve: a caller outside this
# package changing one import would not be a split.

    ONE answer to "where does the index live", and this function is what makes
    it one.

    It was two. The backend imports services/gamemedia/__init__.py, which moves
    the index into GAMECORE_PATH/emu/gamescrape — inside the installation, and
    excluded from the OTA rsync so it survives updates. This file run as a
    plain script never executes that __init__, so `--refresh` built the 234 MB
    index in ~/.cache/gamescrape instead, where the backend never looks.

    Which made the remedy a lie: when the index was missing the backend printed
    "run `gamescrape.py --refresh`", and doing exactly that rebuilt 234 MB at
    the wrong path and changed nothing. Found on a real box, where the
    LaunchBox tier had been silently off since the day it was populated —
    `status()` reported launchbox_index: False with the index sitting on disk
    two directories away, and every lookup fell through to ScreenScraper alone.

    GAMECORE_PATH set means "this is a GameCore install", and then there is
    exactly one right answer. Unset, standalone behaviour is untouched:
    ~/.cache/gamescrape, as the module docstring promises.

    The index is a 234 MB cache — data, so it follows GAMECORE_DATA when the
    installation and the player's data are separate trees. Reading the
    environment here rather than importing `services/paths.py` is deliberate
    and is the one exception `backend/tests/test_paths.py` grants: this file
    is run as a plain script by `install/steps/build-media-index.sh`, where a
    package-relative import has no package to resolve against. The fallback
    keeps it agreeing with `gamemedia/__init__.py`, which does go through
    paths.py — the two must name the same directory or the backend reports a
    media tier it does not have.
