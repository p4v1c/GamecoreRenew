    Split out of the read loop so it can be asked directly — see
    tests/test_standby_input.py. It only counted `EV_KEY` down before, and on
    the pad this box is used with that misses the d-pad entirely: hid-playstation
    reports it as a hat. Pressing a direction woke nothing and, worse, did not
    reset the idle timer, so browsing with the stick alone brought the
    screensaver up on somebody actively using the box.

    Movement is what counts, not position: measured against the axis's last
    reported value rather than its centre. Position would need to know where
    each axis rests, and a trigger rests at its minimum while a stick rests in
    the middle — a rule written as "far from the centre" calls every resting
    trigger a held one. Travel needs to know nothing, and it also means a slow
    drift never adds up to a press however far it wanders.
