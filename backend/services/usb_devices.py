"""The peripherals that are not SDL gamepads, and whether they are on the bus.

The autoconfig pipeline knows exactly one kind of device: a pad that declares
BTN_SOUTH on an evdev node. That is the whole roster — `gamepad_monitor`
enumerates `/dev/input/event*`, `controller_registry` hands out player slots,
and a generator writes a config for whatever took a slot.

Every peripheral that does not enter through that door is invisible:

  · the **GameCube adapter** Dolphin drives over raw libusb. It has no evdev
    node at all, so nothing in the pipeline can see it, and the owner has no
    way to tell "the adapter is not plugged in" from "Dolphin is ignoring it";
  · the **DolphinBar** and its Wiimotes, which enumerate as several HID
    interfaces whose shape depends on the mode switch on the bar;
  · **arcade sticks** that enumerate as a keyboard — they declare no
    BTN_SOUTH, so `pads_by_key()` drops them on purpose;
  · **wheels**, whose force-feedback node is separate from their button node;
  · the **DS3 passthrough** RPCS3 wants over hidraw.

`gamepad_monitor` is right to keep dropping these: a player slot is for
something that can be player 2, and a light gun is not. The gap is that there
was no *other* list either. This is that list.

What a pack declares is in `catalog/<id>/pack.json` under `usb`; whether the
box has it is here. Two verdicts, and nothing in between:

    present     a device with this vendor:product is on the USB bus
    absent      it is not

**Read-only, always.** This module stats sysfs and does nothing else. It never
mounts, never writes a udev rule, never re-triggers udev — the rule text is
carried through to `installer/applier.py`, which is the only place allowed to
put one on a disk, and only at install time.

**Absent never refuses a launch.** That is deliberate, and it is the one design
decision here worth arguing with. Dolphin plays perfectly with a DualShock 4
and no adapter; RPCS3 does not need a real DS3. A USB accessory is by nature
optional, so refusing to start would be GameCore inventing a fault — the exact
mistake `bios.py` documents at length under `required: false`. What the owner
lacks is not permission to play, it is the sentence "the adapter you plugged in
is not being seen", which is what `launch_notice()` returns.
