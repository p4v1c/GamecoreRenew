"""
Background service that reads gamepad events directly from /dev/input via evdev.

This bypasses the Chromium Gamepad API which blocks button 16 (PS/guide button).
When the PS/guide button is detected:
  - If a game is running  → kill it and broadcast gp:guide so the frontend goes home
  - Otherwise             → broadcast gp:guide (frontend can choose to ignore)

Permissions: the process must be able to open /dev/input/event* files.
Either add the user to the 'input' group OR deploy the udev rule from install.sh.
