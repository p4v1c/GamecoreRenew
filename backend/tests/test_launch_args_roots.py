"""What a relative path in a launcher resolves against.

The measurement that produced this file (issue #36): one tile shipped
`args = "lib/<emu>/<emu>.exe --fullscreen=true"` — a bare relative path, and the
only one in the catalogue. Nothing resolved it. `_expand` in routers/systems.py
rewrites `@…@` tokens and returns anything else untouched; `resolve_args` only
substitutes `@APPID@`; `process_manager.launch` hands the string to
`shlex.split` and calls `create_subprocess_exec` with no `cwd=`. So the child
inherited the backend's working directory, which is `WorkingDirectory=$GAMECORE_PATH`
in the systemd unit arch.sh writes.

It worked. It worked because three independent places happened to agree —
the unit's WorkingDirectory, `providers.py`'s `ctx.gamecore_path / spec["dest"]`
where the installer puts the binary, and the string in the pack — and because
nothing said so anywhere. The failure that would have followed is the worst
shape available: the roots split (P12), someone reads `uninstall.sh`, which
lists `lib` beside `emu|config|assets` as something to preserve, concludes it is
player data, moves it to the data root, and the tile launches wine against a
path that no longer exists. Wine reports it, the backend does not, and the
screen shows a game that started and did nothing.

The same row already carries a second relative path, `romsPath`, which IS
resolved — `paths.resolve_data_path`, against the DATA root, with a test of its
own. Two relative paths, one row, two different roots, one of them by accident.

These tests pin the token down instead. They fail on the pre-fix catalogue.
