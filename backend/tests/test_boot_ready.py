"""`/api/ready`, and what the shell is allowed to conclude from it.

The Electron shell has to know when GameCore is *usable*, not when its process
exists. It used to ask `/api/sysinfo`, which answers with the box's IP address
— found by opening a UDP socket towards 8.8.8.8 — its disk usage, its
controller batteries and its BIOS inventory. Polled in a loop, during the one
minute when the box has the least to spare, to answer a question it was never
written for.

Two things are asserted here, and the second matters more than the first:

  · the endpoint is cheap and truthful — no socket, no subprocess, no scan;
  · the startup steps are on the right side of the line. A step is required
    when answering without it would make the front end say something false;
    it is a background step when it only refines what is already true.
