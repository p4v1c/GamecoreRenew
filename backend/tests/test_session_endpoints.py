"""The HTTP contract for suspending a session, and the double-Home gesture.

`/api/games/session` is the shape every theme reads, so its backward
compatibility is load-bearing rather than polite: a front end from before this
feature reads the flat fields as "the game on my screen", and if a suspended
session filled them in, that front end would block its pad on every screen over
a game nobody can see. Which is the exact fault the reconnection guard in
hooks/useWebSocket.ts was written for, reintroduced through a different door.
