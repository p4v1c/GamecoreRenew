"""Who a finished game belongs to, and which console a played hour belongs to.

Two defects from the 2026-09-04 audit (findings 3 and 9) and the reconnection
half of finding 2. They are one file because they are one mistake made in three
places: state that outlives the thing it describes.

  · `_watch()` read the manager's fields *after* its await, so the watcher of a
    game that had exited could describe — and erase — the game started since.
  · `playtime` was keyed by filename alone, so two consoles holding a file of
    the same name shared a row.
  · `ws.connect()` announced a running game and said nothing otherwise, so a
    client that missed `game:finished` during an outage had nothing to correct
    it.

Nothing here starts a process, opens a socket or touches a real database: the
children are fakes with a `wait()` this file resolves by hand, and the database
is `:memory:`.
