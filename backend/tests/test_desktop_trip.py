"""Leaving the console is a trip, not a move.

The interface's exit to the desktop is an entry in the power menu, between
Restart and Shut down, and it is called `desktop`. What it did was rewrite the
display manager's auto-login — persistently, for every boot after it. So a
player who wanted their desktop for ten minutes got it for ever, and coming
back meant knowing the name of a command.

Measured on the reference box: three boots in one day landing on Plasma, each
because a single exit hours earlier had changed how the machine starts. The
owner's own reading of it — "I write in a file to go to desktop mode, and when
I reboot it keeps that" — is exactly right, and is the whole defect.

The switch still has to happen: the display manager is restarted on the spot
and has to be pointed somewhere for the player to land. What changes is that
`--once` leaves a marker, and `gamecore-rearm-console.service` reads it before
the display manager starts at the next boot and puts the console back.

`desktop` without `--once` is untouched. "Stop opening the console" is a real
thing to want and keeps its own command.

Nothing here starts a display manager or writes outside a staging tree.
