"""Unit tests for the gamepad detector (services.gamepad_monitor).

Two failures that both look like "the emulator is broken" from the sofa:
a pad with no Home button never being detected at all, and a Bluetooth pad
losing its player slot when its charging cable is unplugged.

The evdev module is replaced with a fake, so these run on any machine and
without a controller plugged in.
