"""Every file an installer copies must exist where the installer looks.

The failure this exists to stop, in the order it happened:

  1. `refactor(install): un dossier par nature de fichier` moved
     `gamecore-restart.service` into `install/system/` and `gamecore-emu` into
     `install/bin/`.
  2. `install/steps/setup-update-permissions.sh` kept looking for both beside
     itself, as `${HERE}/…`.
  3. It has no `set -e`, so the failed `install` printed one line and carried
     on, wrote a sudoers file holding only half its rules, and **exited 0**.
  4. `arch.sh` runs it as `… && ok "OTA restart permissions installed."`, so
     the installer announced success.

Result: every box built after that commit came up with no
`gamecore-restart.service` — the OTA cannot restart itself — and no
`/usr/local/bin/gamecore-emu`, so "install an emulator" from the Systems screen
does nothing at all. Both reported as installed.

Nothing could see it. The scripts are not executed by CI, shellcheck does not
resolve paths, and the only symptom appears on a fresh box weeks later. So the
references are resolved statically here instead.
