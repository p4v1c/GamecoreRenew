"""`gamecore-emu` on a box whose data does not live inside the install.

Finding 12 of the 2026-09-04 complementary audit. The script has declared
`GAMECORE_DATA` since the split, and then read and wrote `GAMECORE_PATH/config`
anyway: the grid, the operator's own packs and the list of declined packs all
came from the code tree, which on such a box is not where the backend looks.

`gamecore-emu remove azahar` therefore *succeeded* — printed its lines, exited
0 — having rewritten a `systems.json` nothing reads. The tile stayed on the
console's screen, and there was nothing in the log to say why.

The real script is run here, against two temporary trees, with the repository's
own `backend/`, `catalog/` and `scripts/` linked into the code root. Nothing is
installed: `remove` and the grid merge touch JSON files and nothing else.
