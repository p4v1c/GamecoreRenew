"""What the box DOES when a disk arrives or leaves.

`poll_once` is deliberately split out of the sleep loop so all of this is
reachable without a real disk, a real subprocess or a wait: the runner is a
double and the websocket is a list.

The scenario that matters most is the last one — the disk pulled out while a
game is running from it. It is the case a living-room box meets for real, it
cannot be repaired from here, and before this the only thing the player got was
an emulator that froze for no stated reason.
