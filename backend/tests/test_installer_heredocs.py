"""No command runs from inside a file the installer writes.

An unquoted heredoc (`<<EOF`) expands `$(...)` and backticks. The sudoers file
arch.sh writes carried comments quoting `udevadm control` and
`desktop --restart-dm` between backticks: bash ran both, as root, during every
install, and wrote empty gaps where the words were. Variables are why those
heredocs stay unquoted, so the rule is on their bodies: no backtick.
