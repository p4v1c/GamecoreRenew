"""Naming a game, from every container the catalogue declares.

The fixtures below are BUILT, byte by byte, rather than checked in: a real
PARAM.SFO or disc image would be a game dump in the repository, and a recorded
blob nobody can read is a fixture that stops meaning anything the first time it
needs changing. Every one of them is the smallest thing the real parser accepts,
constructed by the same struct layout the parser reads.

The two rows that matter most here are the ones with no fixture to build.
`hash` and `filename` exist because a cartridge dump carries NO identifier —
an N64 or Mega Drive ROM is the game and nothing else — and a design that
assumed "read the id out of the container" would work for today's thirteen
systems and be rewritten by the first retro console anybody adds.
