"""The mapping wizard, end to end: capture → SDL mapping line → autoconfig.

Each link has its own tests — the capture session in test_controller_capture.py,
the database in test_mapping_db.py, the derivation in
test_configgen_snapshots.py. None of them walks the whole way, and the whole
way is what the owner sees: they map an unknown pad from the couch, and the
next time it connects the 3DS emulator has to answer to it.

That chain used to sit next to "Scan mapping" and share words with it
("capture", "mapping", "forget"). Removing that action is exactly the kind of
change that could cut a link here without any single-link test noticing, so
this runs the real modules in order: `controller_capture.start/commit`,
`mapping_db`, then `apply_profile` dispatching to the real azahar generator.

No pad is touched. The device layer — which pads are plugged in, their
/dev/input nodes, the GUIDs SDL computes — is stubbed, the same seams the
capture tests use, and the emulators write into a throwaway HOME built from the
catalogue's own seeds by the characterisation harness.
