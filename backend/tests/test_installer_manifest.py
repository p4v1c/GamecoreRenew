"""Re-running the installer keeps the record of what it created.

arch.sh writes "did this install create it" flags (USER_CREATED,
BRIDGE_VENV_CREATED, LINGER_ENABLED, INPUT_GROUP_ADDED) that uninstall.sh
reads to decide what to remove. The installer recommends running it again; on
that second run the account and the venv exist, created by the first run, and
were recorded as 0. The uninstaller then left GameCore's own user behind.
