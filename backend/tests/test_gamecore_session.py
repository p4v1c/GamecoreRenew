"""`gamecore-session` — the console session, run for real against stubs.

This is the script SDDM executes instead of logging into a desktop. Everything
it talks to is replaced here: `systemctl` records what it was asked, the
compositor is a shell script that behaves as the test needs, and the runtime
directory is a temporary one. Nothing starts a compositor, a session or a unit
on the machine running this.

What is pinned, and why each one is a failure that would only ever be found on
a television:

  · **it ends when the player leaves, and not before.** A session that exits on
    a compositor crash returns to SDDM, which auto-logs straight back in — a
    login loop with no keyboard to break it.
  · **it hands the environment over rather than letting anything guess it.** The
    user manager gets DISPLAY by import; the backend, which is a system unit
    and cannot see any of that, gets a file written at login and removed at
    logout.
  · **it starts a compositor and nothing else.** No plasmashell, no panel, no
    wallpaper: those are the seconds the owner was watching.
