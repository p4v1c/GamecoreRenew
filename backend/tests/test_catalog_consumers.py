"""Every consumer must agree with the catalogue.

This is the file the gopher64 bug dies in.

The N64 slot moved from gopher64 to Rosalie's Mupen GUI in `arch.sh`,
`systems.json.dist`, `config/systems.json` and `controller_profiles.py` — and
was forgotten in four other places. `install-emu-configs.sh` deployed the
curated N64 config to `~/.var/app/io.github.gopher64.gopher64/…`, the `mkdir -p`
CREATED that phantom directory, copied the files, printed a green tick, and RMG
— which reads `~/.var/app/com.github.Rosalie241.RMG/config/RMG/` — never saw any
of it. `uninstall.sh` cleaned the same phantom, `flatpakify-systems.sh` would
have rewritten the launcher to the old app id, and `verify_emulators.py`
reported a healthy Flathub entry for an application nobody installs.

Nothing detected it because nothing compared the four maps against each other.
These tests do, against the single source: `catalog/<id>/pack.json`.

They are written to FAIL on the pre-phase-2 code and pass once each consumer
reads the catalogue instead of its own copy.

    The prune asked `is args.split()[1] in the installed set`. Against

    installed Flatpak", the answer is no for every tile at once, and the

    the probe succeeded, it just answered a question nobody meant to ask.

    Thirteen emulators, all silently dropped, on a box where all thirteen were

    A native tile is added alongside, and it is what makes this test able to
    fail. The prune skips itself entirely when it would empty the grid — a
    sound guard, and one that hides this exact bug: with only Flatpak tiles the
    broken prune drops every one of them, the grid comes out empty, the guard
    fires and puts them all back. The bug is invisible until ONE tile survives
    on its own merits.
