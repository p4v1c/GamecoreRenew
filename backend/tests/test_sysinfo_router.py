"""/api/sysinfo, with every probe failing.

This endpoint feeds the TopBar, which is on screen the whole time the box is
on. Every value in it comes from something that can be absent: a box with no
controller paired has no battery, a box with no network has no route to
8.8.8.8, and /sys/class/power_supply on a machine with no power supplies at all
is an empty directory rather than a missing one.

None of that is exotic — it is a freshly installed box before the first pad is
paired. The failure it must never produce is a 500, because the TopBar polls
this and a home screen that cannot draw its own header looks like a box that
did not boot.

Nothing here reads the real /sys: the probes are pointed at a temporary tree,
so the result does not depend on whether the machine running the suite happens
to have a laptop battery.
