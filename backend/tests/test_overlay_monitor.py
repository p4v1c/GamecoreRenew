"""The overlay monitor's contract with Electron.

It runs as a subprocess of `electron/main.js` and speaks JSON-lines over stdio:
one object per line, flushed. Nothing else enforces that — a stray `print()`, a
missing flush, or an object spread over two lines and the bezel silently stops
following the emulator's window, on a box, with no error anywhere.

X11 is not exercised here. What is exercised is the protocol, and the two
degraded paths a box actually hits: a Wayland session, and python-xlib absent.
