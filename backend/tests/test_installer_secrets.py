"""The scraper keys reach the backend exactly as the owner typed them.

`install/arch.sh` writes them into a systemd drop-in. systemd reads
`Environment=` with its own rules: a space ends an unquoted value, `\\` and `"`
are escapes, and `%h`, `%u`... are expanded. A ScreenScraper password holding
"%h" reached the backend as the home directory, and one holding a quote lost
its line. `sd_env` quotes and escapes; this runs it in bash and reads its
output back with systemd's rules (checked against systemd itself on Arch).
