"""Deploy this release onto a box that predates the code/data split.

This is the test that decides whether the split may ship. The release goes out
over OTA and production boxes take it **unattended**: `update/linux.sh` rsyncs
new code into `GAMECORE_PATH` and excludes `emu/` and `config/` — which are
exactly the two directories this phase teaches the code to stop assuming are
there. If the new code looked for data anywhere other than where the rsync
leaves it, every box would come up with an empty library and no settings, and
nobody would be in front of it.

The rollback is worse. `update/linux.sh` restores from `${GAMECORE_PATH}.prev`,
which holds the *old* code. Had the update moved data, a rollback would face
the old code with a moved tree — two halves out of step and no procedure to
recombine them. So the property asserted here is the strong one: **the update
moves zero bytes of data, and the rollback returns a working box.**

Everything is synthetic. The tree in `tmp_path` imitates an installed box; the
release is `git archive HEAD`, which is what the OTA actually ships. Nothing
here can see, let alone touch, a real installation.

The excludes are **parsed out of `update/linux.sh`** rather than retyped. A
copy would be right the day it was written and wrong the day somebody adds an
exclude — and its being wrong would look exactly like this test passing.
