"""The bounded version scheme: major ≤ 99, minor ≤ 9, patch ≤ 99.

Two things are tested, and the second is the one that would go wrong quietly.

  1. The arithmetic — carries, the migration step, and the refusal at the top.
  2. **That ordering survives a carry.** Every consumer of these numbers
     compares three integers left to right: `routers/update.py:_version_int`,
     `key()` in `update/linux.sh`, and the theme delivery loop. A carry turns
     `1.0.182` into `1.1.82`, whose last field is *smaller* — and if any of
     those comparisons treated the version as one number, every box in the
     field would decide it was already up to date and never take another
     update. That is the failure this file exists to make impossible.
