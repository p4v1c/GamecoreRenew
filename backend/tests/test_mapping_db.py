"""The served mapping database — and the measurement its order rests on.

The whole mapping wizard is worth nothing if the line it captures loses to the
community entry for the same pad. SDL reads a mapping file top to bottom and
does not stop at the first match for a GUID, so which of the two survives is
decided by ORDER alone — and the wrong order fails silently: the file on disk
contains the capture, the emulator ignores it, and the pad behaves exactly as
it did before the owner ran the wizard.

`test_the_last_line_is_the_one_sdl_keeps` is therefore not a unit test of our
code. It is the measurement the code is built on, re-run against every SDL this
box can load, so that an SDL release changing its mind is reported here rather
than discovered on a controller.
