"""The storage endpoints, and the one that matters: Eject.

Listing is the easy half. Pulling a disk with unwritten data is how a save is
lost, and "has it finished writing" is not a question anyone can answer by
looking at it — which is why there is a button rather than a paragraph asking
players to be careful.

Nothing here runs udisksctl: `storage.mount`/`storage.unmount` are replaced, and
what is asserted is the status code the UI has to act on.
