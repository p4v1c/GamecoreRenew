"""Every command a sudoers rule grants must be one this repo actually runs.

`visudo -cf` is the only check the installers had, and it validates SYNTAX. A
rule can parse perfectly and still match nothing, because sudo compares a
command line ARGUMENT BY ARGUMENT: one stray space splits an argument in two
and the rule silently stops applying to anything.

The reference box carries exactly that, granting

    /usr/bin/systemctl is-active gamecore backend.service

— two arguments where the code passes one, `gamecore-backend.service`. Its
`-ui` twin is correct, so half the pair worked and the other half never did.
It fails closed, which is why nobody noticed: sudo simply refuses, and a
refusal is indistinguishable from a feature nobody used.

**No rule in this repository writes that line** (see the phase report), so this
guard is not what would have caught it — nothing in-tree produced it. It exists
because the class is invisible to `visudo`, and the next such rule may well be
written here. What it checks: every argument a rule grants has to appear, as a
whole token, in something this repo actually executes. `backend.service` occurs
nowhere outside `gamecore-backend.service`, and that is the whole tell.

Documentation is deliberately not evidence — a rule quoted in a README is not a
call site — and neither is another sudoers line, or a rule would justify itself.
