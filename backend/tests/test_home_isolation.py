"""The suite must not be able to write the developer's own emulator configs.

Measured, not hypothetical: a `pytest` run rewrote Player 1 of this machine's
RPCS3 `Default.yml` and emptied Ryujinx's `input_config`. `TestClient(main.app)`
runs the app lifespan, the lifespan starts `gamepad_monitor.run()`, and the
monitor scans the REAL `/dev/input`, finds whatever pad the developer left
plugged in, and profiles it against `configgen.HOME` — `Path.home()`, read at
import time. `conftest.py` now points `HOME` at the throwaway root before any
import; nothing guarded that it stays pointed there.

AUDIT pass 6 asked this exact question and cleared it. Its evidence was a run
under a sentinel `HOME` that came back empty — but the write only happens when a
pad is connected, and none was: an experiment that could not fail whatever the
code did. Neither test below depends on what is plugged in.
