"""What a launch does about a peripheral that is not there.

The rule, and it is the opposite of the BIOS gate's: a declared USB accessory
that is absent is SAID and the game starts anyway. Dolphin plays perfectly with
a DualShock 4 and no GameCube adapter, so refusing would invent a fault — while
saying nothing leaves the owner unable to tell an unplugged adapter from one the
sandbox cannot see.

The harness is the BIOS suite's: a system whose binary does not exist, so the
launch always ends at the exec step with 503. That is precisely what makes it
useful here — reaching 503 means nothing upstream refused, which is the whole
assertion.
