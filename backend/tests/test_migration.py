"""The migration, exercised only ever against trees this file built itself.

`scripts/migrate-userdata.py` moves a real person's ROM library, their
playtime and their credentials. The rules it is built on are the ones worth
testing, because each of them exists to make a specific disaster impossible:

  · dry run by default, so a mistyped command is a printout;
  · copy, never delete, so a migration that turns out wrong costs disk space;
  · never overwrite, so a second run cannot damage the first's result;
  · **nothing calls it** — the OTA must not be able to reach it, because a
    release that migrated data on its way in would leave a rollback facing a
    tree the old code cannot read.

That last one is asserted over every tracked file in the repository, and it is
the most important test here: the others check that the script behaves, this
one checks that it is never *invoked*.

Nothing here goes near a real installation. Every path is under `tmp_path`,
and the script refuses `--from`/`--to` pairs that are nested or equal anyway.
