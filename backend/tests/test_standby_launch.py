"""A game starting is the end of standby, whoever started it.

Found chasing the report rather than reported: nothing on the launch path
touched standby. `run()` treats a running game as activity — it keeps pushing
`_last_input` forward so the box cannot fall asleep DURING a game — but it never
undoes a standby that had already begun.

Which is reachable. The pad is not the only thing that can start a game: the web
UI on a phone posts the same endpoint. Box asleep, launch from the sofa, and the
emulator comes up behind a screen the backend has switched off through DPMS,
with `_state` still saying "sleep".

That was already wrong. It became worse with the input guard, because the guard
reads the same state: the front end would have swallowed every press, gp:guide
included, and gp:guide is the only way to end a game. A black screen, a running
emulator, and a pad that cannot stop it.

So the launch wakes the box, before the emulator rather than after — the screen
has to be back before there is anything to see on it.
