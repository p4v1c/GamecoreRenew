"""The two gestures that get a player out of a game, and the debounce under them.

`gp:guide` is the one binding a theme may not take, because it is the only way
back to the interface from inside a running emulator. That makes the pairing
logic in front of it load-bearing in a way its size does not suggest: every
defect below is a player either trapped in a game or thrown out of one they
were still playing.

Nothing here talks to evdev or to a real pad. What is driven is the clock and
the event values, which is all these two gestures actually read.
