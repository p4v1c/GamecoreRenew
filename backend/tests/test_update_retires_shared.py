"""The one-off retirement of `config/themes/_shared/`, run for real.

`_shared/` held the settings screen and power menu both shipped themes
imported. They are host code now — `frontend/src/settings/` — and no theme
imports that path. The directory is inert on an installed box (`list_themes()`
skips any name starting with `_`), and it is removed because a stale copy of a
screen that moved is what somebody edits in three months wondering why nothing
changes.

**The function is extracted from `update/linux.sh` and executed**, never
retyped. A copy of the logic here would be right the day it was written and
wrong the day the script changes — and its being wrong would look exactly like
this file passing.

What must NOT happen is the reason this is a named retirement rather than a
generic prune: the delivery loop promises "on the box, not in the release →
never touched", which is what keeps an operator's own theme safe from an
update. A prune of everything missing from the release would delete exactly the
themes that promise protects.
