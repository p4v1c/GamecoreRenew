"""The Electron shell's overlay lifecycle, exercised as JavaScript.

`electron/main.js` is the one file in this project that no Python test can
reason about: the bezel window's geometry and the cancellation of a launch are
decisions taken in JavaScript, against Electron's own API. So the bench next to
it (`electron/test/`) runs the real module in a VM with Electron, the child
processes and the network replaced, and this wrapper is what makes it part of
`pytest backend/tests` rather than a file somebody has to remember to run.

Skipped, not failed, where there is no `node`: the backend's own test job does
not need one, and a skip says so where a failure would look like a defect in
the shell.
