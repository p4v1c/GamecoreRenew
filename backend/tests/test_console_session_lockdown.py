"""The console session as a console: no way out that a gamepad cannot undo.

Four defects, found on a reference box that had stopped booting into GameCore
and could not be told why from its own shell. They are one file because they
are one story — the box was in desktop mode, nothing said so, and every symptom
the owner reported followed from that:

  · `gamecore-session-select` wrote its auto-login drop-in under sudo's umask,
    so the file came out root-only. `status`, whose own usage says it needs no
    root, then skipped the one file that decides everything and reported the
    next `[Autologin]` down — on a Plasma box, `plasma`. An armed console
    reported as "desktop", and a disarmed one reported the same: the command
    could not be wrong out loud.
  · `gamecore-launcher` could only draw the interface OVER the desktop, and
    called that starting GameCore. It is not the console: the desktop's window
    manager still owns Alt+Tab and Meta, which is exactly how a player ends up
    looking at a desktop a gamepad cannot drive.
  · the console session itself started its window manager with whatever key
    bindings that machine's defaults carried — Alt+Tab, Alt+F4, Meta — so the
    real session was escapable too.
  · `gamecore-ui.service` carried `StartLimitIntervalSec`/`StartLimitBurst` in
    `[Service]`, where systemd ignores them with a warning. The restart bound
    its own comment describes did not exist.

Nothing here starts a compositor, a session or a display manager. The session
script runs for real against stubs; the switch runs against a staging tree.
