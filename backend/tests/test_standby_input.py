"""What the box counts as somebody being there.

Reported from the sofa: standby "n'est pas très réactif, on dirait qu'il faut
que j'appuie sur le pad de ma PS4 pour réveiller le boîtier". That is not a
feeling, it is the rule the code had: `_watch_device` counted `EV_KEY` down and
nothing else.

On a DualShock 4 — the pad on the box — the d-pad is not EV_KEY. hid-playstation
reports it as a hat, `ABS_HAT0X` / `ABS_HAT0Y`, and the sticks are `ABS_*` too.
So the two most natural ways to say "I am here" were invisible:

  · pressing a direction did not wake the box, and
  · worse, it did not reset the idle timer either — browse a menu with the stick
    alone and the screensaver comes up while you are using it.

The fix cannot be "count every ABS event": a resting stick reports constantly,
and a box that treats jitter as activity never sleeps at all. So movement is
what counts, measured against the axis's own travel — which is why the decision
is a function that can be asked directly, instead of a condition buried in an
async read loop nobody can drive from a test.

# sofa: the television goes dark during a game and no button brings it back,
# while the pad's own touchpad does.
#
# That asymmetry is not GameCore's doing and cannot be fixed in GameCore's own
# standby. The box runs Plasma on Wayland; the screen is blanked by the
# session's power manager on a timer of its own, and the compositor never sees
# a button because the kernel tags those `ID_INPUT_JOYSTICK` and libinput does
# not handle joysticks. The touchpad arrives on a separate node tagged
# `ID_INPUT_TOUCHPAD`, which it does handle — hence "only the controller is
# affected", on the very same controller.
#
# So on_input() now also says so on the session bus. These tests pin the two
# properties that make that safe: it is said on a press, and it is NOT said
# eighty times a second while somebody swings a stick.
