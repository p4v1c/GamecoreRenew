"""The privileges a release adds after a box was installed.

Sudoers rules are written ONCE, at install time, by `arch.sh` and
`setup-update-permissions.sh`. An OTA replaces code and nothing else: it runs
as the backend's user and cannot grant itself anything. So every rule added in
a later release is simply absent on every box installed before it, for ever,
and the feature it gates is dead without a word.

Found on the reference box, running a release fourteen tags old:

  · no NOPASSWD rule for `/usr/local/bin/gamecore-emu`, and the CLI not
    installed at all — so "install an emulator" from the Systems screen could
    not work. The endpoint answered, the catalogue listed seventeen packs, and
    the button was never going to do anything.
  · no rule for `cpupower`, so `standby.py` never dropped or raised the
    governor. It logs at debug and carries on, which is why nobody saw it: the
    only trace was `sudo: a password is required` in the journal.

`update/linux.sh` cannot repair either — that is the point of the rule being
root-owned. What it can do is stop the drift being invisible, and what this
file guards is that it keeps being able to.
