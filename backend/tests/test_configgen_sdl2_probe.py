"""`sdl2_probe` — telling "SDL said no" apart from "SDL was never asked".

The reference box logged `SDL2 probe failed for 045e:02fd` three times over
several days, each at the instant a Bluetooth Xbox pad connected, and the
player was told *SDL2 would not report a GUID for 045e:02fd*. Those are not
the same sentence: the probe subprocess had raised, so SDL never answered at
all. Measured minutes afterwards, the same host SDL2 and the same libSDL2.so
bundled with Ryujinx both returned `050018dc5e040000fd02000003090000` — ten
runs out of ten, 0.85 s each, against an 8 s timeout.

Both facts used to leave `sdl2_probe` as an empty dict, which is why the
give-up could only name the commoner one, and why the errno behind those three
lines is now unrecoverable: the handler discarded the exception too.

#
# The second failure this file records, and the more expensive one, because it
# produced an answer instead of an absence.
#
# `sdl2_probe` is one of the two SOURCES `inputs.py` is built on: it is asked
# what SDL ITSELF knows about a pad, precisely where the owner's capture must
# not be believed. On the reference box it answered with the capture. SDL reads
# a mapping table from SDL_GAMECONTROLLERCONFIG_FILE and keeps the LAST line it
# finds for a GUID, so a table carrying the owner's line beats SDL's built-in —
# and the same DualShock 4, the same code, at the same instant:
#
#     probe in a fresh process     start:b6  back:b4  leftshoulder:b9   dpup:b11
#     probe in a backend that had  start:b9  back:b8  leftshoulder:b4   dpup:h0.1
#     enumerated a pad once
#
# The second line is the capture, in the LINUX JOYSTICK driver's numbering, for
# a pad SDL drives through HIDAPI. It reached azahar as `start` on that
# driver's L1 and a D-pad bound to a hat SDL calls buttons 11-14 — reported in
# game as "l1 = option, le pad directionnel ne fonctionne pas". `evdev_driven()`
# answered False throughout: the guard was never wrong, it was bypassed.
