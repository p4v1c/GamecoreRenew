"""A pack nobody anticipated must come out of every consumer that reads the
catalogue.

Three bugs of the same shape were found and fixed in one afternoon, and none of
them was visible from anywhere:

  · `scripts/gen-catalog.py` built the grid with
    `[tile(packs[i]) for i in SYSTEM_ORDER if i in packs]` — a pack absent from
    that list produced no tile at all;
  · the same file did the same thing for the installer's tick boxes, so a new
    system could not even be selected at install time;
  · `backend/services/configgen/__init__.py` walked a `STEP_ORDER` tuple of ten
    ids — an emulator missing from it was NEVER profiled, so its pad did
    nothing, on a real box, and not one line of output said so.

All three were found by asking "what happens to a brand new pack?". Nothing
asked that question systematically: there were three point tests where one
general one was needed. This is that test.

**What it checks, and what it deliberately does not.** Every consumer is fed a
catalogue containing all the real packs plus one fictional newcomer, and must
either emit the newcomer or drop it for a reason the pack itself DECLARES —
`strategy: none`, no `install` block, the wrong `kind`. "Not in a list in this
file" is never an acceptable reason, and that is the only failure mode this
file exists to catch.

The newcomer deliberately declares no `order` and no `controllers.order`: those
are exactly the fields whose absence used to mean "dropped". A pack that forgets
them must be placed badly, never be missing.

Re-introduce a hardcoded id list in any consumer below and this file goes red.
