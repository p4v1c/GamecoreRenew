"""Shared pytest setup for the backend test suite.

The one thing that must happen before anything else: point GAMECORE_PATH at a
throwaway directory. `backend.config` reads it at import time and every other
path — covers cache, config/, playtime.db — is derived from it, so whichever
test module pytest imports first would otherwise bind the suite to the real
checkout (or worse, to whatever GAMECORE_PATH the shell already exported) and
the cover tests would scribble their .miss markers into it.

conftest.py is imported before any test module, which makes this the only place
the override is guaranteed to land in time. GAMECORE_TEST_ROOT is the handshake:
test_covers.py builds its fake game tree there instead of minting its own root.

# harmless for anything importing the backend. It is not harmless for the two
# CLIs: `gamecore-emu` and `gamecore-addon` are installed to /usr/local/bin and
# have no checkout to read, so when the variable is absent they ask
# `systemctl show gamecore-backend.service` for it — and on a developer's own
# box that answers with the REAL data root. A test that runs either of them
# without this line edits the grid of the machine it is running on. It is not
# hypothetical: it happened while the CLI's own tests were being written, and
# the console lost an emulator to a passing `pytest`.

# And the runtime directory, which is how the box tells the backend about its
# graphical session.
#
# `process_manager.session_env_file()` reads $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/gamecore/session.env
# — written by the console session at login — and `_display_env()` trusts it
# ahead of probing for a display. Left inherited, the suite reads the session
# file of the machine running it: on a developer's desktop there is none and
# everything passes, and on an armed box the probe never runs and five tests in
# test_session_robustness.py go red for a reason that has nothing to do with the
# code under test. Found exactly that way, the first night the reference box ran
# the console session.

# Same rule for the ScreenScraper account. gamescrape reads the four variables
# below, then falls back to ~/.config/gamescrape/credentials — a developer's own
# file, which would make the suite behave differently on their machine than in
# CI. It matters more than it looks: with credentials present, the gamemedia
# tier is enabled, cannot reach the network from a test, and correctly reports
# "unreachable" — which suppresses the .miss marker test_covers asserts on. The
# suite's baseline is an unconfigured box; a test that wants the tier enables it
# itself.

# profiles it against the REAL home. Measured on this machine: a test-suite run
# rewrote Player 1 of ~/.var/app/net.rpcs3.RPCS3/…/Default.yml and emptied
# Ryujinx's input_config. The developer's own console, edited by pytest.
