"""Two launches in quick succession: the second is refused before it touches disk.

The foreground check used to repeat only at spawn. The second request ran
`_prepare` (profile saves, per-game config, pack prepare) over the game being
started, then, refused at spawn, released the profile saves with `started=now`,
which passed the `_placed_at > started` guard and reset the running game's saves.
