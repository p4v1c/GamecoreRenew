"""The addon lifecycle endpoints.

The CLI is never actually run: every test stubs the subprocess, the same way
test_catalog_router.py does. What is asserted is what protects the box — what
may be named, what argv is built, and that two operations cannot overwrite each
other.

An addon install is the one thing on this screen that runs a script and clones
a repository. If it 500s, the Addons screen shows a stack trace where a message
belongs; if the argv drifts, it runs the wrong binary as the wrong user; if two
of them run at once, the second overwrites the first's checkout halfway
through. None of the three is visible from CI without this file.
