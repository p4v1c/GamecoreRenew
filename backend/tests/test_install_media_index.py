"""`install/steps/build-media-index.sh` — the step that gives a fresh box a
metadata source at all.

Run for real, against a throwaway GAMECORE_PATH and a stand-in gamescrape.py
that records how it was called. Nothing here downloads 234 MB, and nothing here
touches a real installation.

What is worth pinning, and why each one is a failure that happened or would
never be noticed:

  · **it never fails the install.** arch.sh warns and carries on for a dozen
    recoverable failures on purpose — a missing description is a degraded box,
    an aborted installer at 80 % is a machine that is neither installed nor
    clean. Every path through this script must exit 0.
  · **GAMECORE_PATH reaches gamescrape.** That single variable is what makes
    the index land in the installation instead of the invoking user's
    ~/.cache — the exact bug found on the reference box, where the tier was
    silently off with the index sitting on disk two directories away.
  · **it is idempotent.** Re-running the installer is documented as safe, and
    re-downloading 234 MB because someone ran it twice is not safe, it is rude.
  · **a stand-in that lies is caught.** A build that exits 0 and writes nothing
    is the shape of failure hardest to see, so the script checks the file
    rather than the exit code alone.
