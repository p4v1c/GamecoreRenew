"""Nothing outside `services/paths.py` may decide where data lives.

The split this file guards is invisible while it works. `GAMECORE_DATA`
defaults to the installation, so a module that builds `GAMECORE_ROOT /
"config" / "x.json"` by hand is byte-for-byte correct today, passes every
test, and runs correctly on every box — right up until the root is mounted
read-only or the data is moved to `/userdata`. Then it fails, at runtime, on
somebody's television, and the traceback names a file rather than the decision
that put it there.

That is not a thing code review reliably catches: the wrong line and the right
line look identical, and there are a dozen of each. So it is checked
mechanically, on the two halves of the rule:

  · no module outside paths.py joins a writable directory onto the code root;
  · no module outside paths.py reads GAMECORE_PATH or GAMECORE_DATA from the
    environment, which is the other way to mint a second opinion about the
    roots.

The rest of the file asserts the property the OTA release depends on: with
`GAMECORE_DATA` unset, every path resolves to exactly where it resolved
before this change. Zero bytes move, so the update is non-destructive by
construction rather than by inspection.
